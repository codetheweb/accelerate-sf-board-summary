The san francisco board of

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:21.755
homeland of the ramaytush

inhabitants of the san
francisco peninsula. As the

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.857
indigenous stewards of this
land and in accordance with
their traditions, the ramaytush

00:01:23.857 --> 00:01:26.360
ohlone have never ceded, lost
nor forgotten their
responsibilities as the
caretakers of this place, as

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.395

reside in their traditional

resolutions adopted.

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.882
Next item, please.

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:37.553
>> item 18 is third draft of
charter amendment to amend the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.540
charter of city and county of

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.725
san francisco to define full

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.162
duty sworn offices to establish
minimum staffing level for

00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:48.364
sworn officer of the police
department.

00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:51.734
>> supervisor safai and so far
you are the sponsor of this

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:54.737
charter amendment, the one late
charter amendment to be

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:57.600
considered today, I will call
on you first.

00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:00.100
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.
Thank you colleagues.

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.346
There is a lot of consternation

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:07.830
around this measure, not
exactly clear why.

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:12.321
There has been some
misinformation promoted about

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:14.956
this measure, and to be honest,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.327
I didn't think I would be
standing here today as the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.830
sponsor of this measure.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:24.366
This measure evolved in a way I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.902
think is healthy what debate we
need to have in san francisco,

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:30.573
but I want to go back to things
I said in committee, having

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:32.908
served on the budget committee

00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:38.248
for the past three years, first
under chair haney, then chair

00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:42.584
ronan and now chair chan, this

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.256
is and will be the most
difficult budget that I faced

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.859
in seven years on the board of
supervisors.

00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.261
We are approaching at least

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:54.965
right now they say a half
billion dollar deficit.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.690
They anticipate it growing to 7

00:06:00.738 --> 00:06:02.738
or $800 million and last year

00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:05.307
we had people coming to our

00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:07.843
chamber talking about food

00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:11.214
security, programs being cut.

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:14.518
We had children people carrying
babies, child care providers

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.919
talking about the threat of

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.922
their programs being cut.

00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:22.592
We had senior programs after

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:26.730
school programs, we had many
different vital and core

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.934
services in our city on the
chopping block and that was

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:32.803
with a quarter of billion
dollar budget deficit.

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.674
We are now facing over a half
billion dollar budget deficit

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.710
and that is a fact and it is

00:06:41.913 --> 00:06:43.913
continuing to grow.

00:06:44.183 --> 00:06:47.840
When this charter amendment was
proposed, the conversation

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.589
revolved around how we would
one, increase the minimum

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.291
number of officers that have

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760
declined over the last five

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.799
years and now how are we going
to creatively recruit and get

00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:04.569
more people back in potentially
through recruitment fund.

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:07.604
Let me say this, and again,

00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:09.606
serving on the budget committee

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.343
serves us well in this
conversation.

00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:15.746
We tomorrow at the budget
committee will hear a request

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:19.749
from the department of public

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:27.291
health to take $39.5 million

00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:29.993
from funded unfilled positions

00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:33.296
and convert that into overtime.

00:07:33.665 --> 00:07:35.665
Those positions are

00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:39.271
predominantly nurses and nurses
assistants that have not been

00:07:39.572 --> 00:07:41.573
hired or filled in the city and
county of san francisco.

00:07:43.643 --> 00:07:45.643
When you go to laguna honda and

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:47.678
when you go to the emergency

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:51.616
room at sf general, we are down
emergency room nurses.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.620
When you call 911 in this city

00:07:57.223 --> 00:07:59.525
right now, we are only meeting
the required response time, 70

00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:02.270
percent of the time.
71 percent of the time to be

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.270
exact.

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:08.333
Because we are down 30 to 40,
911 call operators.

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:12.636
We are down sheriffs, we are

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.441
down paramedics, we are down
mental health technicians, we

00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:18.243
are down firefighters and yes
we are down police officers.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.981
If we are going to have a
conversation about public
safety in the city, we need to

00:08:24.884 --> 00:08:27.152
talk about all aspects of
public safety that includes all

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:30.523
of the people on the front
lines in this position.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.362
I am not prepared to get into a
conversation of pitting peter

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.980
against paul or taking money
from one area of the government

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:41.866
and shifting over to the other

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:44.502
without a true funding source

00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:47.138
and that is the responsibility

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.677
of this body to be thoughtful,
to be responsible and to think

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.481
about all aspects of government.
I understand over the last

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.284
couple years people are very
concerned about public safety

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:01.419
and they should be, but it

00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:04.156
needs to be approached in
healthy thoughtful way.

00:09:05.493 --> 00:09:07.994
We made a amendment, that
amendment said from the

00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:10.830
original charter there needs to
be a identified source of

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.999
funding and that includes going

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.402
and modifying an existing tax
and looking for a way to pay

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.905
for this in a thoughtful way.
But I think when we do that and

00:09:20.841 --> 00:09:22.841
that would be a second step,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.812
not included in this proposal,
that's when we should have a

00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:28.914
real conversation about all

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.316
aspects of public safety in

00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:35.154
when we are approaching a full
conversation.

00:09:35.856 --> 00:09:37.757
I want to thank all of the
individuals that have been

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:40.794
involved in the conversation.
i want to thank supervisor

00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:45.298
dorsey for moving the
conversation forward, but I

00:09:46.334 --> 00:09:48.735
will say, the idea when things
are amended, that is a normal

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:50.269
process and the legislative
process.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.839
That is a normal part of what

00:09:53.974 --> 00:09:56.777
we do in this body and that
happened time and time again

00:09:57.245 --> 00:09:59.245
and so I think the end result

00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:03.750
we have here is one that is
doing two things.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.953
It is changing the conversation
around minimum police staffing

00:10:09.457 --> 00:10:11.457
which I think is a good thing

00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:14.462
and secondarily saying we need
to be fiscally responsible and

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.865
identify a sort of funding and
do it in a thoughtful way, so

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.367
colleagues I ask for your
support on this today.

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:22.535
I think that there is a lot

00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:25.871
more room for conversation.

00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:27.875
I hope supervisor dorsey and I
can come together and continue

00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:31.278
to work on this as we have on
other things in this body, and

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.160
I think that all of us will be
better served by the end result.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500
Thank you MR. PRESIDENT.

00:10:38.286 --> 00:10:40.254
>> thank you supervisor safai.
Supervisor engardio.

00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:42.488
>> thank you.

00:10:42.657 --> 00:10:44.657
I want to explain why I will be

00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:47.561
voting no on this measure.
I have been a strong advocate

00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:53.534
for funding and hiring more
police officers.
We face a police staffing
crisis and short hundreds of

00:10:56.238 --> 00:10:58.238
officers for a city our size.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.742
I need to explain why I'm
voting no a measure on its face

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:04.611
looks like a measure to fund

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.180
and hire more police officers.

00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:10.151
This measure does nothing
concrete to fund and hire
police.

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:13.540
It is aspirational.
it doesn't set aside funds in

00:11:15.357 --> 00:11:17.291
the budget, it only suggests
reallocating money from current

00:11:18.327 --> 00:11:20.328
taxes that are volatile and
inconsistent income.

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:23.663
This measure is merely

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.103
aspirational because it is not
a new dedicated tax.

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.873
It refers to the possibility of
using a unnamed tax in the

00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:35.243
future and that raises legal
concerns for me.

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:38.478
Taxes that pay for specific

00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:42.516
things require 2/3 majority.

00:11:42.752 --> 00:11:45.687
Simple majority are easier to
pass, but can the next pay for

00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:48.256
something specific by police?
Our city has been sued in the

00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:51.893
past over these very questions.
In short, this measure is messy

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:54.663
and it doesn't do anything to
immediately fund and hire

00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:56.663
police.

00:11:56.832 --> 00:11:59.235
We need to scrap this measure,
start over, take the politics

00:12:00.503 --> 00:12:02.838
out of it and work together to
give san francisco residents

00:12:04.607 --> 00:12:07.750
what they are begging for,
better public safety.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.178
Better public safety starts
with funding and hiring more

00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:13.682
police officers.
It also includes more sheriff

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.417
deputies and first responders

00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:19.521
like paramedics and 911
operators.

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:24.393
Let's talk about 911 operators.
They are underpaid and stressed

00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:28.897
to the max and leaving in
droves.
We can all have the police

00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:30.965
officers in the world but what

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:34.270
is the point if we don't have
essential workers answering the

00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.205
phone when residents have have
a emergency?

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:40.420
>> this measure is messy
because it started as one

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.344
thing, a set aside for police

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.415
fundjug became another thing
which doesn't dedicate any

00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:48.317
definitive funding.
A lot of politic s happened and

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:53.689
this measure has become the

00:12:56.827 --> 00:12:59.128
political footple football for
the upcoming election year.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.400
Some politicians will win and

00:13:05.902 --> 00:13:08.270
some will lose but for
residents of san francisco it

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.730
is all a loss.

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:14.811
We can't play politics in
public safety.

00:13:17.147 --> 00:13:19.147
Include 911 operators and

00:13:19.183 --> 00:13:21.450
police officers and first
responders to create a public

00:13:26.524 --> 00:13:28.524
safety set aside for for the

00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:31.428
NOVEMBER ballot.
There are basic residents

00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:35.310
expect city hall to cover.
A fully staffed police

00:13:35.632 --> 00:13:38.601
department and 911 call center
is as basic as it gets.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.604
Without public safety, nothing
else matters.

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:43.939
Put the politics aside and do

00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:47.911
the work our constitch tuents
are demanding.

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:50.480
>> supervisor ronan.
>> thank you.

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.517
I have to say I'm a little
confused now.

00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:57.619
Mostly by the sponsor's speech.

00:13:57.855 --> 00:13:59.855
So, I have a couple of

00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:02.626
questions maybe for the city
attorney or for the controller

00:14:04.996 --> 00:14:06.996
or for the author.

00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:12.435
As I read this measure, it

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.720
would appear that any future
revenue measure that we would

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.430
put on the ballot would pass.

00:14:20.412 --> 00:14:22.412
That it would first have to go

00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:25.849
to fund a minimum amount of
police before the revenue could

00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:29.952
be used for anything else.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.892
Am I reading that correctly?
>> deputy city attorney ann

00:14:34.892 --> 00:14:37.940
pearson.
The measure includes the term,

00:14:37.229 --> 00:14:40.164
the full und ifing gate and
that is a date when certain

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.868
parts of the charter amendment
would become operative and the

00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:46.536
full funding date is defined as

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.641
the date when the controller
certifies that the voters

00:14:52.777 --> 00:14:54.712
passed a tax measure that
dedicate funding for this

00:14:55.848 --> 00:14:58.416
purpose or will increase
funding sufficient to cover the

00:14:58.817 --> 00:15:00.817
cost of this.

00:15:02.153 --> 00:15:04.154
When that date happens, the
funding requirements of this

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.890
charter amendment will go into

00:15:07.692 --> 00:15:10.594
effect, so when that date
happens the city would be

00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:14.466
required to appropriate funds
consistent with this and

00:15:15.634 --> 00:15:18.336
deposit money into the fund.
>> so in plain language because

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:21.204
that is how I read it as well.

00:15:21.907 --> 00:15:23.907
What that means is that any new

00:15:24.443 --> 00:15:27.344
revenue measure that goes on
the ballot first has to be used

00:15:28.348 --> 00:15:30.348
to fund minimum staffing for

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.617
police before it could be fund
anything else?

00:15:33.653 --> 00:15:36.521
>> I don't think that is
exactly right.
There could be a revenue

00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:39.691
measure that is specific tax
earmarked for something else.

00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:42.593
>> for a specific tax, but a
general tax?

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.199
>> if there is a general tax
that doesn't raise sufficient

00:15:48.268 --> 00:15:50.469
revenue to cover these costs
that would not trigger, but if

00:15:52.138 --> 00:15:54.672
there is a general tax that in
the controller estimation

00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:56.673
generates enough revenue to

00:15:57.643 --> 00:15:59.643
cover the cost of this ballot

00:16:01.247 --> 00:16:02.680
measure, it would trigger these
requirements.

00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:05.283
>> so, if there is another

00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:08.653
pandemic we wouldn't be able to

00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:10.721
raise general revenue to cover

00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:15.600
health cost or housing or
healthcare or anything else?

00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:17.828
If it was enough a general tax

00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:22.668
to cover the minimum
staffing -- this is the worst

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.570
written piece of legislation I

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.608
think I've seen in 15 years on
this board.

00:16:29.876 --> 00:16:31.876
That's unbelievable.

00:16:32.812 --> 00:16:34.812
We are tying our hands in the

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.810
future, which means that unless

00:16:37.884 --> 00:16:39.884
we specifically want to raise

00:16:40.754 --> 00:16:43.723
revenue to hire police why even
try?
No matter what is happening.

00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:47.590
No matter if there is a
pandemic or homeless crisis

00:16:47.794 --> 00:16:49.794
gets worse, no matter if there

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.430
is a staffing crisis in any

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.868
other profession and both of my
colleagues just named about a

00:16:56.503 --> 00:16:58.503
dozen where we have minimum

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:00.940
staffing and I have to agree
with supervisor engardio, this

00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.744
is a mess of a piece of
legislation because it started

00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:06.120
as something completely
different which by the way I

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.790
would have been against as

00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:10.916
well, but it started as
something completely different

00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:15.154
and has meshed into not nothing

00:17:15.256 --> 00:17:17.256
but something that ties our

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:20.259
hands and can prohibit us from

00:17:20.327 --> 00:17:22.195
achieving true public safety in
the future.

00:17:23.363 --> 00:17:25.363
You gave a speech supervisor

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:29.535
safai all about the fact public
safety requires many things.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500
It does require police, but it

00:17:33.274 --> 00:17:35.274
also requires mental health

00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:37.676
counselors and housing for the

00:17:38.546 --> 00:17:41.414
homeless and drug treatment
programs, and economic
development programs.

00:17:43.517 --> 00:17:45.517
All of these things together is

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:48.587
what makes public safety.

00:17:49.524 --> 00:17:52.192
Correct me if I'm wrong,
colleagues, but didn't just 3

00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:56.896
years ago PRESIDENT Norman yee

00:17:57.532 --> 00:18:00.000
put something on the ballot to
not put arbitrary numbers in

00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:04.204
the charter to staff at any
level?
we just did that.

00:18:04.338 --> 00:18:06.338
It passed with incredible

00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.841
support from the publux because

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.944
it doesn't make sense to put
random numbers that represent a

00:18:11.913 --> 00:18:14.470
specific moment in time in our
city consitution.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.984
That's why we elect leaders to
make judgment calls about how

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.622
to use limited funds in a
specific period of time when

00:18:25.527 --> 00:18:27.527
the city is a complicated place

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.300
facing many challenges and to
divide those funds as

00:18:30.198 --> 00:18:31.765
appropriate at a particularly
given time.

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:35.536
Yes, we have set asides because
we decide some things are so

00:18:36.437 --> 00:18:38.605
important that we should always
fund them, and I understand

00:18:39.774 --> 00:18:41.774
that there was a effort to do

00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:45.379
that at first, but what we have
here makes absolutely zero

00:18:46.548 --> 00:18:48.716
sense to me.
I'll also just have to say and

00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:52.185
why I would have opposed

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.420
supervisor dorsey's original

00:18:54.923 --> 00:18:56.923
measure as well, since 2017

00:18:58.627 --> 00:19:00.627
this board has increased sfpd

00:19:03.499 --> 00:19:05.499
funding by over $200 million.

00:19:08.103 --> 00:19:10.103
Just this year alone sfusd came

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.540
to us and asked for $60 million

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.776
increase to their budget, $25
million budget supplemental to

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:18.879
pay for overtime cost and a new

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:21.815
mou with their union for $166

00:19:22.418 --> 00:19:24.752
million over three years to
fund recruitment and retention

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.870
bonus we gave it to them.

00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:29.756
The past two years when sfpd

00:19:29.758 --> 00:19:31.758
and the mayor came to us with a

00:19:35.364 --> 00:19:37.933
budget for police, we gave ever
cent they asked for.

00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:41.302
Yes, police are important to
public safety.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.107
They dont make public safety.
They are important component to
insure public safety and we

00:19:47.376 --> 00:19:49.277
understood the department has
been under-staffed for some

00:19:50.613 --> 00:19:53.448
time so this board and this
mayor have supported all the

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.500
efforts to recruit new

00:19:56.452 --> 00:19:58.487
officers, to hire new officers,
to pay competitive rates.

00:19:59.522 --> 00:20:02.257
We have done that and haven't
said no for over two years and

00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:05.994
in fact we said yes to a
massive increase just a few

00:20:05.994 --> 00:20:07.994
days ago.

00:20:09.466 --> 00:20:12.340
Just a few years ago we took
arbitrary numbers out of the

00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:16.371
charter when it comes to police
staffing, because we decided it

00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:19.774
didn't make sense and it passed

00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:21.476
with you know, incredible
support.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.130
Now we have this non-sensical

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.500
ballot measure that creates a

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:32.988
fund that we might be forced to
put money into if we put a

00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:38.930
revenue tax on the ballot.
As someone who supported every

00:20:38.361 --> 00:20:40.729
new revenue measure and every
new tax against the rich has

00:20:43.814 --> 00:20:46.202
that been on the ballot I would
not support that measure with
this in place because what you

00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:48.603
are saying is that money will

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.740
go straight to the cops!

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:53.842
When people are starving in the
street.

00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:57.480
The lecture or introduction
that supervisor safai gave, I

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.781
agreed with everything he had
to say.

00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:03.190
That is precisely why I'm not
supporting the measure.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.530
This makes so sense colleagues

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.550
and hope you will join

00:21:07.491 --> 00:21:09.893
supervisor engardio and me for
completely different reasons to

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.130
say no to this horrible mess of

00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:17.699
a piece of legislation.

00:21:23.507 --> 00:21:25.542
>> supervisor dorsey.
>> thank you.

00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:28.144
Colleagues I don't believe
there is a single issue more

00:21:28.512 --> 00:21:30.512
important to san francisco

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:33.716
residents and businesses today
then public safety and I don't

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.540
believe there is a single

00:21:38.222 --> 00:21:40.222
factor more consequential to

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.193
making progress on those public
safety challenges then

00:21:43.694 --> 00:21:45.694
fulfilling the promise of a

00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:49.598
fully staffed police department.
Last month when the police

00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:53.869
department presented to this

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:56.106
board, we heard sobering
numbers.

00:21:56.841 --> 00:21:58.875
1/3 of the police department
supposed to be in san francisco

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.510
isn't there right now.

00:22:02.513 --> 00:22:05.415
We are on pace to lose another
300 police officers who are

00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:09.351
eligible for full retirement

00:22:09.487 --> 00:22:12.356
right now.
A police commander described

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:17.861
this situation as potentially
catastrophic and the thing

00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:20.330
about what we are trying to
deal with here is that much of

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:25.602
what we are facing in police
under-staffing as a crisis
isn't unique to san francisco

00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:28.839
and in fact this is a nation
wide phenomenon.

00:22:31.109 --> 00:22:33.877
Much is demographic issue that
owes to bill clinton running

00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:38.381
for PRESIDENT In 1992 and

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:40.483
making commitments we put a

00:22:40.685 --> 00:22:43.187
hundred thousand cops on the
street and it was 125 thousand

00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:45.624
cops.
It turns out also police

00:22:45.624 --> 00:22:47.624
officers will retire.

00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:51.495
This was a foreseeable crisis
we probably should have been

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.865
doing more to solve sooner then
we did, but the fact is right

00:22:57.536 --> 00:22:59.771
now we are not competing as
effectively against other

00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:01.771
jurisdictions in northern

00:23:02.373 --> 00:23:04.373
california as we could be and

00:23:04.543 --> 00:23:07.211
that's why I was working on a
charter amendment for most of

00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:10.281
this year and I appreciate
everybody whether we agree or

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.180
not, I appreciate the spirit of

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.620
cooperation about addressing

00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:19.689
this issue and trying to

00:23:19.824 --> 00:23:22.327
address some of the things that
I think 1994 charter amendment

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.896
got wrong that supervisor ronan
talked about.

00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:28.498
I agree, we shouldn't have a

00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:31.869
arbitrary number in the charter
that stays there forever and

00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:36.107
think there was a right move,
prop e in 2020 to amend that.

00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:38.777
What I wanted to do in the
charter amendment we are

00:23:41.848 --> 00:23:44.716
proposing before it was
hijacked was to have a process

00:23:45.451 --> 00:23:47.451
for how we could have a minimum

00:23:48.554 --> 00:23:51.255
staffing level that is adjusted
over time.

00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:54.791
But, it turns out that there

00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:57.161
was a hostile amendment offered.

00:23:57.697 --> 00:23:59.697
This is now not a police

00:24:03.302 --> 00:24:05.670
staffing measure, this now has
a contingency in it that it

00:24:09.708 --> 00:24:12.443
will not take effect unless and
until "a future tax measure

00:24:18.785 --> 00:24:20.953
passed by the voters" is
"generate sufficient general

00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:24.356
revenue to recruit and hire
more police.".

00:24:25.324 --> 00:24:27.527
The notion san franciscans can
only expect a fully staffed

00:24:27.527 --> 00:24:30.228
police department if they are
willing to pay extra for it in

00:24:31.998 --> 00:24:34.700
my view is a marketing gimmick
worthy of spirit airlines and

00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:37.302
not something a responsible

00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:39.871
city government should be doing.

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:43.107
I believe that voters deserve

00:24:44.344 --> 00:24:47.245
the agency because it is there
dollars to prioritize police

00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:49.781
staffing for just a five year

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.150
period to get us from a

00:24:52.886 --> 00:24:55.455
historic low of something like
700 cops short to a fully

00:24:55.455 --> 00:24:57.690
staffed police department in a
way that won't break the bank

00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:01.292
that had the support of the

00:25:01.361 --> 00:25:03.962
mayor budget also, the mayor
policy director, mayor, former

00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:06.965
chief of police, current chief

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.380
of police.
We are a city that is too
invested in being safe and
clean and welcoming to our

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.140
residents and our businesses,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.543
to commuters to tourists and
convention airs.

00:25:18.712 --> 00:25:20.913
This is a vices we cannot
afford not to solve.

00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:24.251
I think voters deserve the
agency to prioritize that.

00:25:24.285 --> 00:25:25.552
I'm disappointed they won't get
it.

00:25:27.888 --> 00:25:29.888
What they will get instead is a

00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:32.459
cop tax scream and will say
this, I don't this can this is

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.361
something that will go over
well with voters.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.970
I think this is going to be an

00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:41.101
election where people want
solutions on public safety and

00:25:41.302 --> 00:25:43.302
I don't think they are getting

00:25:44.138 --> 00:25:46.639
it with the measure as amended,
so I will be opposing it.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.843
I know we will have people from
different perspectives MAY

00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:54.280
agree on this, but I hope you
join me in voting no.
Thank you.

00:25:57.184 --> 00:26:00.154
>> thank you supervisor dorsey.
MR. Controller, sorry to put

00:26:01.122 --> 00:26:03.122
you on the spot and this might

00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:09.663
take you a minute, but how many
approximately funded, vacant,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.634
rank and file, q2 police
officer positions currently

00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:19.339
exist in the san francisco

00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:44.198
police department?
Take your time.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.100
We'll give you a couple minutes.

00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.101
While you're looking at that,

00:26:50.472 --> 00:26:52.472
how many academy classes were

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.510
provided for in this year's

00:26:57.479 --> 00:26:59.479
23/24 budget MADAM Budget

00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:01.848
chair?

00:27:02.717 --> 00:27:04.717
>> total budget of $785 million

00:27:05.954 --> 00:27:08.923
out of which that included four
police academy classes.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.280
>> each academy class if fully
subcribed is how many
individuals?

00:27:14.129 --> 00:27:16.531
>> san francisco police
department is expected to hire

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:19.866
in the next five fiscal years

00:27:20.602 --> 00:27:22.336
each year up to a hundred
police officers.

00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:26.975
That was the goal and they have
been falling short not for the

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.430
short of budget, but the fact

00:27:31.313 --> 00:27:33.140
that they really need help to
have recruitment strategy.

00:27:34.249 --> 00:27:36.249
This is the reason why in a

00:27:36.719 --> 00:27:38.719
previous budget year this body

00:27:39.888 --> 00:27:42.189
also approve a budget that
includes $600 thousand to

00:27:44.927 --> 00:27:46.995
provide the police department a
recruitment consultant to allow

00:27:49.865 --> 00:27:52.600
them to help with recruitment.
>> so it isn't lack of funding

00:27:54.436 --> 00:27:56.504
MADAM Chair, it is lack of
applicants?
>> absolutely.

00:27:57.339 --> 00:28:00.108
But we do have good news and I
mean, I don't want to take

00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:02.711
words out of the police
department mouth and the

00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:07.114
previous fiscal year they only

00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:10.351
have six graduate in the police

00:28:10.453 --> 00:28:12.453
academy but most recently had

00:28:12.788 --> 00:28:15.590
25 graduate police academy
class and lateral hiring up to

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:18.159
30 police officers from other
counties.

00:28:21.364 --> 00:28:24.333
>> got it.
MR. Controller...

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ben

00:28:28.671 --> 00:28:31.573
roseenfield, the department has
300 vacant funded q2 positions

00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:35.242
vacent in the current budget.

00:28:35.645 --> 00:28:38.181
>> thank you.
Supervisor preston.

00:28:42.786 --> 00:28:45.870
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.
I have comments on this one.

00:28:46.456 --> 00:28:48.456
I want to start I will not

00:28:48.591 --> 00:28:50.591
repeat some of the points that

00:28:51.127 --> 00:28:53.127
my colleague supervisor ronan

00:28:54.498 --> 00:28:56.966
made around the impact on
future tax revenue measures.

00:28:58.902 --> 00:29:00.902
I will say that while I believe

00:29:01.304 --> 00:29:03.706
it was unintentional, I believe
that this effectively this

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:07.409
charter amendment is a were it

00:29:08.578 --> 00:29:10.578
to pass is a poison pill on

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:12.648
future general revenue

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.285
measures, which would be very
difficult to move forward and

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.220
win support of through 2029 if

00:29:21.692 --> 00:29:23.692
this measure passes for the

00:29:23.727 --> 00:29:26.462
reason supervisor ronan
identified.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.100
I want to articulate some

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:34.838
concerns about the policy
underlying this charter

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.730
amendment and those would be
similar comments that I would

00:29:39.643 --> 00:29:41.643
have made to the original

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.580
dorsey measure and now the

00:29:46.517 --> 00:29:49.219
safai measure, and we talked
about a lot of issues already.

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:52.655
I don't want to cover ground

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:55.250
people covered, but the
amendment does-the charter

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:57.659
amendment proposes to do two

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.420
things.
It assigns minimum staffing
number undoing the previous
voter approved chapter
amendment that had removed that
minimum.

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:09.205
That's the first thing and the

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.342
second thing it does is when a

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.110
trigger is met it implements a

00:30:16.113 --> 00:30:18.113
mandatory set aside of up to

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:21.417
$30 million per year for new

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.753
higher bonuses for police

00:30:25.923 --> 00:30:27.923
officers, $75 thousand a head.

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:31.161
Regarding the minimum staffing
number, I think we all can

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:33.229
appreciate people wanting more

00:30:34.298 --> 00:30:36.298
efficient and timely responses

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:40.370
when they contact sfpd and in
need and experiencing a

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.206
emergency, folks deserve in

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.810
this city to have a quick
response and I don't think

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.881
anyone on this board -- I hope no
one on the board disagrees with

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500
that rbs I don't think anyone

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.621
does and think we also agree
too many of our constituents

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.289
are not getting that kind of

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:01.458
response they are entitled to

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.761
and should get and it is
necessary.

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:08.165
I understand fully the
frustration among a lot of

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
constituents that leads to some

00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:14.271
of this policy discussion.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.840
That said, there is just no

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.145
indication at all and no
evidence that reinstituteing

00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:24.381
this minimum staffing number

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:26.816
will fix this isue in any way.

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:32.157
According to the newest metric
staffing report, community

00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:34.759
generated calls for service are
actually down in comparison

00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:37.794
with similar calls before the

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.310
pandemic in 2018.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.350
That informed the previously

00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:47.671
suggested staffing numbers.

00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:51.777
Why this fact declining calls
for service is totally absent

00:31:52.912 --> 00:31:54.912
from the discussion of police

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:58.160
staffing levels when we discuss
this, that has nothing to do

00:31:58.717 --> 00:32:01.119
with public safety, nothing to
do with policy, has everything

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.910
to do with politics.

00:32:07.227 --> 00:32:08.994
And more importantly, simply
playing with theoretical

00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:12.764
minimums in a charter amendment
whether the original one or the

00:32:13.533 --> 00:32:15.533
amended one does that magically

00:32:15.635 --> 00:32:17.635
create new police officers to

00:32:18.204 --> 00:32:20.204
the point about that supervisor

00:32:22.275 --> 00:32:25.100
walton has spoken to many times
and PRESIDENT Peskin alluded to

00:32:25.145 --> 00:32:27.450
around the vacancies.
This police department is

00:32:27.914 --> 00:32:30.849
funded for all the staffing
needs and hiring needs and then

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.486
some as supervisor ronan
pointed out getting literally

00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:38.756
hundreds of millions dollar of

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.560
increases and yet they still

00:32:42.696 --> 00:32:45.664
lack the officers they say they
need and cannot fill the

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:48.601
academies, so why is this going
to be any different?

00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:52.104
there is also a question and
think it is a important one

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.940
when we discuss this of whether

00:32:57.644 --> 00:32:59.644
resources would be adequately

00:32:59.646 --> 00:33:01.646
deployed even if this measure

00:33:01.682 --> 00:33:03.616
could recruit and result in the
recruitment of enough officers

00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:06.985
to meet the minimum staffing

00:33:08.455 --> 00:33:10.455
numbers that are being proposed.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.690
We know that the issue facing

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.970
many of our neighborhoods and
many constituents, especially

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.990
our low income neighborhoods is

00:33:22.536 --> 00:33:25.505
not overall sfpd staffing, but
rather the deployment of

00:33:27.607 --> 00:33:29.607
officers and how a department

00:33:31.979 --> 00:33:34.381
with a ever growing seemingly
limitless budget and funding,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.180
how they choose to spend their
money.

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:40.819
So, our downtown shopping

00:33:41.922 --> 00:33:43.922
district right now is literally

00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:47.593
flooded with police officers
and many will proudly tell you

00:33:48.896 --> 00:33:50.896
about the plan to flood

00:33:51.666 --> 00:33:54.234
downtown with police officers.
You go down there right now,

00:33:54.435 --> 00:33:56.435
they are everywhere.

00:33:56.737 --> 00:33:58.538
Police officers are everywhere
downtown.

00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.176
But we can't get in the
tenderloin a consistent

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.440
presence of police on blocks

00:34:06.446 --> 00:34:08.446
that have suffered repeated

00:34:10.518 --> 00:34:12.252
shootings just in the last week
and homicides.

00:34:12.687 --> 00:34:14.988
That's not because of shortage
of police officers.

00:34:15.289 --> 00:34:16.590
Let's be really clear about
that.

00:34:18.993 --> 00:34:21.261
It isn't because of shortage of
police officers.

00:34:22.396 --> 00:34:24.396
So, massive police presence

00:34:25.467 --> 00:34:27.467
downtown and little effort to

00:34:28.403 --> 00:34:30.671
deter or prevent violent crime
in troubled residential

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.720
neighborhoods, that's the

00:34:35.176 --> 00:34:38.450
realty in san francisco.
Big downtown corporations and

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.180
rich neighborhoods get all the

00:34:41.816 --> 00:34:44.485
policing they ask for.
While low income high crime

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200
areas struggle for coverage

00:34:48.857 --> 00:34:51.225
unless it is part of a made for
tv campaign to arrest people

00:34:53.695 --> 00:34:56.463
for their drug addiction and
temporarily move them from

00:34:57.198 --> 00:34:59.198
public view only so they can

00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:01.935
return later in the day to the

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
same place and at higher risk

00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:08.475
of overdose fatality.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.945
So, colleagues, this is why we
called for and thank you for

00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.282
the supporting the budget
legislative analyst audit of

00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:18.190
san francisco police department
oferntime deployment.

00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:21.356
Reforming how the san francisco
police department deploys

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.625
officers and are criteria
guiding that exercise of

00:35:26.127 --> 00:35:28.127
discretion will do far more to

00:35:28.697 --> 00:35:31.131
address the situation then yet
another mound of funding that

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:36.104
comes with no accountability
what so ever.

00:35:37.606 --> 00:35:40.175
The second part of the charter
amendment, the mandatory set

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.910
aside for hiring bonus is

00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:46.480
deeply concerning on many
levels.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.683
Particularly concerning to me
as chair of government audit

00:35:49.585 --> 00:35:51.585
oversight committee and as

00:35:51.787 --> 00:35:53.787
supervisor ronan mentioned the

00:35:53.923 --> 00:35:56.658
gao heard various union
memorandums of understanding

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.940
with the city including the mou

00:36:02.181 --> 00:36:04.966
with the police officers
association.
Police officers association

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:07.167
overwhelmingly ratified the mou

00:36:08.337 --> 00:36:10.337
with the city and mou that

00:36:10.573 --> 00:36:12.573
secured another $167 million

00:36:13.342 --> 00:36:14.643
for police over the next three
years.

00:36:15.611 --> 00:36:18.547
The mou process did not result
in a proposal or include

00:36:22.418 --> 00:36:24.352
proposal for hiring bonus after
extensive negotiation with

00:36:25.187 --> 00:36:27.187
department of human resources.

00:36:28.892 --> 00:36:30.892
They negotiated many things,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.270
including bonuses, they didn't

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.364
include the hiring bonuses that
now appear.

00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:40.535
The poa and dhr did not propose
the hiring bonuses to the board

00:36:40.636 --> 00:36:43.405
during a process that took
place less then a year ago when

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.600
the board was asked to approve

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:48.643
and did approve $167 million of

00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:51.312
increases as part of a

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:54.783
unprecedented package of raises
and bonuses so don't where the

00:36:55.752 --> 00:36:57.986
sudden call for $75 thousand
hiring bonuses on top of all

00:36:58.721 --> 00:37:00.721
the bonuses that have already

00:37:01.658 --> 00:37:03.260
been promised sfpd is coming
from.

00:37:04.294 --> 00:37:06.729
I'm not convinced throwing this
money at recruitment bonus and

00:37:07.965 --> 00:37:10.400
new hires in the manner that
would be required by this

00:37:11.935 --> 00:37:14.470
charter amendment will have its
intended effect and once

00:37:16.473 --> 00:37:18.473
triggered this set aside will

00:37:18.475 --> 00:37:21.244
certainly take money from other
crucial city needs and divert

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.480
them to the san francisco
police department over and

00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:29.785
above the massive budget

00:37:30.521 --> 00:37:32.521
increases sfpd has already

00:37:32.689 --> 00:37:34.689
secured in successive budget

00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:36.958
cycles year after year after

00:37:40.398 --> 00:37:43.233
year and through the latest mou.
Colleagues I wish we had a

00:37:44.702 --> 00:37:46.702
charter amendment that improved

00:37:47.571 --> 00:37:50.373
public safety and addressed the
actual desire of our

00:37:50.974 --> 00:37:52.775
constituents for greater
community safety.

00:37:55.513 --> 00:37:57.748
This isn't it and I will be
voting no.

00:37:59.517 --> 00:38:01.517
>> supervisor walton.

00:38:02.153 --> 00:38:04.153
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin

00:38:04.288 --> 00:38:06.723
and I will not be long in
comments because I have spoken

00:38:08.125 --> 00:38:10.827
on this several times in
committee, but I do want to

00:38:11.395 --> 00:38:13.395
reiterate that our police

00:38:13.832 --> 00:38:15.832
department is already fully

00:38:17.235 --> 00:38:19.336
funded, and when supervisor
chan demonstrated that numbers

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.710
that have been going to the

00:38:22.273 --> 00:38:24.273
police academy over the last

00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:26.709
couple years that number 25

00:38:26.777 --> 00:38:29.679
which is what the police
department promoted for

00:38:30.582 --> 00:38:33.840
recruitment classes was a
number that was dummied down.

00:38:34.152 --> 00:38:37.870
A real police academy class is
supposed to require about 50

00:38:37.922 --> 00:38:39.922
police officers, that is per

00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:42.191
the chief of police and we have

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.260
not gotten anywhere near those

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:45.996
numbers, so the issue with the
police department most

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.168
certainly is the fact that we
have not provided young people

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.441
or people in community with the
excitement about becoming a
police officer.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.430
That has to change if we want

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.120
to get a fully staffed
department.

00:39:02.447 --> 00:39:05.350
Minimum staffing numbers have
never been achieved
historically.

00:39:07.186 --> 00:39:09.186
Give me a date and time when we

00:39:09.188 --> 00:39:11.188
achieved minimum staffing

00:39:11.289 --> 00:39:13.591
numbers, I would love to see it
because it doesn't exist.

00:39:14.259 --> 00:39:16.259
We never achieved minimum

00:39:18.597 --> 00:39:20.597
staffing levels, and most

00:39:20.799 --> 00:39:23.568
certainly this charter
amendment as presented by

00:39:24.537 --> 00:39:26.471
supervisor dorsey and quite
frankly the current one, the

00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:28.639
goal of the charter amendment

00:39:28.707 --> 00:39:30.707
will never be achieved.

00:39:32.478 --> 00:39:34.478
We will not achieve minimum

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.470
staffing levels per this

00:39:38.683 --> 00:39:40.683
charter, but at the very least,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.255
we should have a dedicated
funding source if that is the

00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:49.259
goal and if this is passed.

00:39:51.897 --> 00:39:53.897
So, I will be supporting the

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800
amended charter because if for

00:39:57.303 --> 00:39:59.338
some reason this was to move
forward, there should

00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:02.808
definitely be a committed
funding source for minimum

00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.876
staffing levels, which are

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.580
arbitrary and will not be

00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:11.782
achieved.

00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:14.551
>> supervisor chan.

00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:18.322
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:21.527
and colleagues, I think when
supervisor dorsey brought this

00:40:22.862 --> 00:40:24.862
introduced it before us the

00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:27.698
original version I think I

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.669
was-I have a lot of questions
about it, especially as

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.300
supervisor ronan has referenced

00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:36.241
that we just voted on this as a

00:40:38.578 --> 00:40:40.578
city to really undo the minimum

00:40:40.713 --> 00:40:43.482
number that was a ballot
measure championed by former

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:46.884
board PRESIDENT Norman yee with

00:40:48.121 --> 00:40:50.121
understanding that we need to

00:40:50.624 --> 00:40:52.624
be intellectially honest how

00:40:52.893 --> 00:40:54.893
many officers do we exactly

00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.495
need and let's have independent

00:40:58.665 --> 00:41:00.665
studies which was conducted by

00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:03.868
under the leadership of former

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.305
police commission PRESIDENT
Malia cohen and that came

00:41:07.207 --> 00:41:09.207
understanding we need roughly

00:41:10.944 --> 00:41:12.944
up to 2100 police officers.

00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:17.583
It was a study that was issued
MARCH 2022.

00:41:18.618 --> 00:41:20.618
Along that time, we recognize

00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:23.855
that that was the need for the

00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:27.794
city and that is during the
budget the most recent budget

00:41:29.263 --> 00:41:31.263
that I supported the total like

00:41:32.132 --> 00:41:34.934
I mentioned earlier, a total of
$785 million of police annual

00:41:36.403 --> 00:41:39.305
budget that is included four
police academy classes.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.740
During the same time period

00:41:42.743 --> 00:41:44.743
MARCH this year, this body also

00:41:44.845 --> 00:41:46.845
approved an mou for our police

00:41:47.348 --> 00:41:49.490
officers with 10 percent salary
increase.

00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:52.384
In that mou also included

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:54.519
retention and bonus for the 5th

00:41:54.922 --> 00:41:57.456
year, 7th year and 8th year of
police officers.

00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:00.625
With that, it is the reason why

00:42:01.763 --> 00:42:03.763
i was surprised when supervisor

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:07.534
dorsey introduced this ballot
measure from the perspective

00:42:11.705 --> 00:42:14.107
that we ought to mandate this
with minimum police staffing

00:42:15.843 --> 00:42:18.812
when it seemed to me that the
administration and this body in

00:42:20.214 --> 00:42:22.214
the last year and a half and

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.650
definitely put the money where

00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:27.553
our mouth is to continue to

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:30.389
fund the staffing and to drive

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.793
toward that goal, recognizing
especially during the $25

00:42:35.397 --> 00:42:37.397
million police overtime that we

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.367
approve, during that
presentation I asked
specifically the police

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.938
department to talk about their
recruitment strategy and why I

00:42:44.939 --> 00:42:47.874
know they consistently say they
need to recruit up to hundred

00:42:48.676 --> 00:42:50.676
police officer per fiscal year

00:42:51.345 --> 00:42:53.345
in the next 5 fiscal years for

00:42:56.318 --> 00:42:57.618
the city to meet that staffing
goal.

00:42:58.553 --> 00:43:01.156
So, again, I was surprised
supervisor dorsey when he

00:43:01.156 --> 00:43:03.156
introduced this ballot measure.

00:43:03.658 --> 00:43:05.692
It seems to me though it is
actually speaking volume about

00:43:08.396 --> 00:43:11.332
the lack of confidence in our
administration.
That clearly there was lack of

00:43:13.435 --> 00:43:15.603
trust at the mayor in her
proposed budget in the coming

00:43:16.538 --> 00:43:18.538
years will be able to fund our

00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:21.141
police department to meet those

00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:23.643
public safety mandates that the

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.810
city deserves and I while I

00:43:29.652 --> 00:43:32.520
question that, but I do
understand.
I share concern how this

00:43:33.956 --> 00:43:35.956
administration our mayor is -- it

00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:38.258
is not capable to continue to

00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:41.163
be able to deliver efficient
city services, including public

00:43:41.163 --> 00:43:43.163
safety.

00:43:43.465 --> 00:43:45.367
The reason why that our
constituents frankly especially

00:43:46.102 --> 00:43:48.102
in the richmond for us time and

00:43:50.206 --> 00:43:52.207
time again we know we are the
least -- actually police station

00:43:53.442 --> 00:43:55.442
with the least staffing in the

00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:57.611
entire city, we have time and

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.470
time again demanded resources

00:44:00.883 --> 00:44:02.883
and police staffing and also

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.860
ambassadors and yet we did not

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.455
hear back from the mayor and
her office to be able to make

00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:10.859
that commitment and to so much
later including a murder that

00:44:12.762 --> 00:44:14.696
actually have to take place in
richmond market.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.970
And then now leading to this

00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:19.333
space where we also facing

00:44:19.436 --> 00:44:21.837
budget deficit and we cannot
figure out a way to really make

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.390
sure that our city budget is

00:44:25.174 --> 00:44:27.174
equitable to insure public

00:44:28.211 --> 00:44:30.211
safety, not just staffing for

00:44:31.247 --> 00:44:33.582
our police officer, but all
around, firefighters, 911 call

00:44:34.283 --> 00:44:36.283
dispatchers and more.

00:44:37.287 --> 00:44:40.189
So, with that, it has been
challenging and difficult and

00:44:40.757 --> 00:44:42.858
here we are -- I just want to
remind us today though, I think

00:44:43.593 --> 00:44:45.593
there are other ballot measures

00:44:45.762 --> 00:44:47.762
that I voted in the last few

00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:50.466
weeks in support of it.
Not necessarily means that I

00:44:50.466 --> 00:44:52.466
completely in agreement with

00:44:52.935 --> 00:44:55.638
it, but I do understand that
you know, what we are doing

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.390
here today is that we are going

00:44:58.675 --> 00:45:00.843
to present this to voters and
have them decide and whether

00:45:03.914 --> 00:45:06.148
this is something that we-that
they believe that is the best

00:45:06.583 --> 00:45:09.251
way for the city to approach
public safety and many other

00:45:09.786 --> 00:45:11.553
related issues we will see in
MARCH ballot.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.258
The reason I will be supporting
this ballot measure today,b

00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:19.194
that to actually present it

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.320
again to the voters and let the
voters decide.
Thank you.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.320
>> supervisor stefani.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.700
Colleagues, thank you so much

00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:33.900
for your comments thus far.
They really helped to solidify

00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:35.411
how I will be voting and I do

00:45:35.946 --> 00:45:37.946
want to say a few things about

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.480
some comments that were said in

00:45:41.151 --> 00:45:43.920
terms of policing right now.
Police downtown right now, most

00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:48.158
are there on overtime and the
tenderloin station is the

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:50.327
highest staffed station in the
city.

00:45:51.429 --> 00:45:53.797
They get the most resources of
any station to deal with the

00:45:54.498 --> 00:45:57.433
problems in the issues that are
there and also I just want to

00:45:58.969 --> 00:46:01.537
clarify too, the poa asked for
hiring bonus during

00:46:04.342 --> 00:46:06.776
negotiations and the city
denied it so wanted to get that

00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:12.281
out and be clear on a few facts.

00:46:13.217 --> 00:46:15.217
To be honest, the contempt and

00:46:15.653 --> 00:46:18.880
bitterness around this vote is
beyond distressing to me.

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:20.824
I find it extremely
unproductive and hurtful to a

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.580
lot of people who are just

00:46:23.261 --> 00:46:25.262
trying to make a difference and
tackle our most pressing

00:46:25.997 --> 00:46:27.997
problems in the way this is

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.700
unfolded and ing things said

00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:36.373
to one another have been to me
problematic.
I consider san francisco to be

00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:39.577
the city of saint francis, I
say it all the time in the

00:46:39.577 --> 00:46:42.790
chambers.
I hold myself to the goal to

00:46:42.948 --> 00:46:44.948
always try to be a channel of

00:46:45.884 --> 00:46:47.884
peace and that means when there

00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:52.289
is hatred bring love, discord
bring harmony, error bringing

00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:55.224
truth and dispair bring hope.

00:46:55.693 --> 00:46:58.396
MAY sound corny to some, but
hasn't let me down yet and

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:00.865
approach today's vote with that
in mind.

00:47:01.466 --> 00:47:03.868
I have had to put all the noise
aside with this, because there

00:47:06.738 --> 00:47:09.730
is a lot, and ask myself what I
think is the right thing to do

00:47:09.808 --> 00:47:12.743
here and what I think get to
the goal in the first place,

00:47:13.144 --> 00:47:15.713
more police officers which is
the entire reason this policy

00:47:16.148 --> 00:47:17.482
was put forth in the first
place.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.860
I started down this path with
supervisor dorsey because I

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.788
absolutely agree with him that
we don't have enough police

00:47:24.957 --> 00:47:27.224
officers to address the
concerns that our constituents

00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:31.861
are voicing to us on a daily

00:47:32.164 --> 00:47:35.330
basis and agree with supervisor
walton when he says we haven't

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.301
made it interesting enough for
people to become police officer

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.270
jz that is where we also need

00:47:40.272 --> 00:47:43.107
to be focusing our efforts.
Public safety as I said over

00:47:44.676 --> 00:47:46.676
and over again here is a

00:47:49.982 --> 00:47:51.683
baseline obligation of what a
well functioning city

00:47:52.185 --> 00:47:54.185
government should do and think

00:47:54.487 --> 00:47:56.889
it is crisis we are 600 police
officers short to meet demand

00:47:56.889 --> 00:47:59.290
for service.
That is based on a formial

00:47:59.992 --> 00:48:02.493
agreed to and approved and
chief scott has routinely come

00:48:05.798 --> 00:48:07.399
to this board and has informed
us of.

00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:10.302
Like I said, public safety is
foundational.

00:48:12.271 --> 00:48:14.306
Our ability to recover from the
pandemic is continuing to be

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.609
hampered by the police officer
shortage in a myriad of ways.

00:48:18.544 --> 00:48:21.479
It is something I see in my
district every day and

00:48:23.249 --> 00:48:25.249
throughout the city, but I

00:48:26.353 --> 00:48:28.353
believe we need a fiscal plan

00:48:28.555 --> 00:48:31.156
to get there and support any
measure to increase police

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.925
staffing without forcing
lay-offs for other essential

00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:37.729
workers to pay for it.
911 dispatchers, nurses and

00:48:38.464 --> 00:48:41.199
other public safety workers.
I approached this decision with

00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.404
the same seriousness and focus
I have with previous public

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.720
safety matters during my all

00:48:48.575 --> 00:48:51.276
most now 6 year tenure in this
seat and really become a pro

00:48:52.178 --> 00:48:54.413
taking a lot of serious heat on
my past decisions no matter

00:48:55.882 --> 00:48:58.483
where it is coming from so used
to it, but I will always do

00:48:59.419 --> 00:49:00.820
quhut I think is right in the
situation.

00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:05.524
I consistent ly supported the
police and championed public

00:49:06.426 --> 00:49:08.694
safety policy and why I support
the mayor safer san francisco

00:49:09.629 --> 00:49:11.564
proposal and despite the
political ferve surrounding

00:49:11.631 --> 00:49:13.631
this issue, iment to emphasize

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.769
that I will always endorse
proposals aimed at enhancing

00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:19.571
public safety.

00:49:20.941 --> 00:49:23.509
I have stated too I'm not
inclined to say on housing

00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:26.546
issues and other policies and
not inclined perfect to be the

00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:31.500
enemy of the good.
My position is consistent with

00:49:32.218 --> 00:49:34.218
past action such as refusal to

00:49:35.289 --> 00:49:37.289
vote for the 2020 city budget

00:49:38.426 --> 00:49:40.861
at a time when I thought was
insufficient funding for police

00:49:40.861 --> 00:49:42.861
and struggling businesses in

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.965
the middle of the pandemic.
Voting history on police

00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:50.770
commission appointees reflect
[Indiscernible] Again, I have

00:49:51.138 --> 00:49:53.138
taken other serious votes on

00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:56.542
police issues here at the board

00:49:56.844 --> 00:49:58.844
that I stand by and like I

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:02.348
said, got me a lot of flack,
but recent incidents in dist

00:50:02.883 --> 00:50:05.752
rblth 2 including attack on
muni driver, shootings, retail

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.540
theft and first hand experience

00:50:09.858 --> 00:50:12.226
like car break in and home
burglary underscore the urgency

00:50:12.393 --> 00:50:14.393
to address the safety concerns.

00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:16.762
One of the most basic functions

00:50:16.964 --> 00:50:18.965
is to insure residents safety
and peace of mind.

00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:21.968
It is evident to me that we
have fallen short in this

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.539
regard and I am determined to
see tangible improvements.

00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:30.770
My priority is to make
decisions that yield what I

00:50:31.579 --> 00:50:33.579
think are positive outcomes.

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:36.383
I had concerns with this
measure first proposed due to

00:50:37.485 --> 00:50:39.620
the set aside allocation jz
knew it would be a problem

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.620
getting through the board.

00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:45.457
In san francisco alone, we have

00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:48.461
22 baseline set asides already.

00:50:49.231 --> 00:50:51.231
That exceeds the total in every

00:50:52.233 --> 00:50:54.134
other city and county in the
state combined.

00:50:54.369 --> 00:50:56.369
In fact, local governments in

00:50:56.538 --> 00:50:58.538
the rest of california have a

00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:01.308
total of 10 similar funding
requirements for comparison to

00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:06.130
other cities, los angeles has
adopted two requirements, san

00:51:06.648 --> 00:51:08.648
diego one, and san jose has

00:51:10.185 --> 00:51:11.753
none and that is based on a
controller's report.

00:51:12.787 --> 00:51:15.689
Concerns with set asides are
not new to anyone who has been

00:51:16.658 --> 00:51:18.658
paying attention to san

00:51:19.295 --> 00:51:21.930
francisco politics and in 2008
the voters told us they had had

00:51:23.432 --> 00:51:25.432
enough of set asides.

00:51:26.368 --> 00:51:28.368
Prop s set a policy back then

00:51:28.637 --> 00:51:31.272
which pass said by the voters,
non binding like other policy

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.740
statements we are putting on

00:51:34.409 --> 00:51:37.312
the ballot in MARCH, that set
aside, this is what proposition

00:51:39.949 --> 00:51:41.949
s said in 2008, that set asides

00:51:43.686 --> 00:51:45.820
would be voted on only if
paired with adequate new source

00:51:46.255 --> 00:51:48.255
of funds so the implementation

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.290
of the set aside will not cause

00:51:52.394 --> 00:51:54.997
a net decrease in general fund
revenues.

00:51:55.965 --> 00:51:57.965
Because set asides limit

00:51:58.601 --> 00:52:00.535
discretionary spending it urkt
further constricts our spending

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:03.570
in time of economic downturns

00:52:05.374 --> 00:52:07.909
which we all know are on the
horizon.
Total funding set aside for

00:52:08.711 --> 00:52:10.711
this budget amount to $2.1

00:52:13.216 --> 00:52:15.216
billion out of a total of 4.5

00:52:15.251 --> 00:52:17.251
billion in general fund

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.856
aggregate discretionary revenue
leaving with $2.4 billion in

00:52:19.856 --> 00:52:21.856
discretionary revenue.

00:52:23.392 --> 00:52:25.392
That is not a lot out of a $14

00:52:25.594 --> 00:52:27.495
plus billion budget in san
francisco.

00:52:28.532 --> 00:52:30.532
My point is that, it is hard

00:52:30.667 --> 00:52:33.270
when you are talking about set
asides, they are very hard to

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.270
legislate, especially here at

00:52:36.473 --> 00:52:38.473
the board and not shocking

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.411
other public safety personnel
like 911 dispatchers working

00:52:42.712 --> 00:52:44.712
double shift get nervous and

00:52:45.114 --> 00:52:48.170
feel left out during this
process.
The question naturally becomes

00:52:48.719 --> 00:52:51.587
how do we pay for this?
It certainly does not have to

00:52:53.156 --> 00:52:55.491
be with a new and future tax
measure.
The language states it could be

00:52:56.659 --> 00:52:59.128
paid for by a measure that
amend an existing general or

00:53:00.396 --> 00:53:03.310
special tax to dedicate and or
increase tax revenue to support

00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:06.636
police staffing and recruitment
at the new minimum levels.

00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:10.239
So, we don't have to pass a new

00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:13.341
tax for this to be meaningful.

00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:17.680
I do want to thank mad,
supervisor dorsey for even

00:53:17.814 --> 00:53:19.814
bringing us to this point.

00:53:20.417 --> 00:53:22.417
We do have people that probably

00:53:23.454 --> 00:53:26.560
haven't agreed to before
publicly that we need more

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.725
officers and minimum staffing
will be in the charter with

00:53:28.992 --> 00:53:31.527
meaning behind it, not just a
number that someone came up

00:53:33.463 --> 00:53:35.632
with and if the voters agree we
know we have to find a way to

00:53:35.632 --> 00:53:37.632
pay for it.

00:53:38.369 --> 00:53:40.270
my goal would be to redirect
dollars from existing tax which

00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:43.306
I think is very doable.
I think that is moving the

00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:47.110
needle in the right direction.
I know it isn't exactly how it

00:53:48.745 --> 00:53:50.745
was envisioned to begin and

00:53:52.582 --> 00:53:54.617
this has been mentioned as a
poison bill but supervisor

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.388
dorsey I think you planted a
seed and pushed the board to

00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:01.825
commit to doing more on this
isue.
The proposed measure provides

00:54:02.994 --> 00:54:05.362
voters with a chance to express
we are not voting on anything

00:54:05.596 --> 00:54:08.198
other then giving the voters to
tell us what they think.

00:54:09.767 --> 00:54:12.135
That's what we are doing,
putting something on the ballot

00:54:12.269 --> 00:54:13.970
for the voters to tell what
they think.

00:54:14.806 --> 00:54:17.741
A chance to express whether
they desire more police
presence.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.710
If that's the case, the wheel

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.946
work will commence to establish
a dedicated meaningful funding

00:54:23.247 --> 00:54:25.815
stream for our police
department and I repeat, it

00:54:26.651 --> 00:54:29.850
doesn't have to be a new tax.
We are not sending a tax

00:54:31.156 --> 00:54:33.223
measure to the voters today.
I guarantee you, I will be

00:54:33.825 --> 00:54:36.426
working oen a way to make
certain we have real funding

00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:39.290
streams in place and continue
to vote for more police

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.732
officers like I have
consistently done on this board

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.800
and that includes figuring out

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.905
ways as supervisor walton said
to figure how to get more

00:54:51.476 --> 00:54:53.476
police officer tuesday to

00:54:53.645 --> 00:54:55.120
come here and be police
officers.

00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:58.616
We can vote on recruitment,
retention and overtime and

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.351
other ways to bring more
officers regardless what goes

00:55:01.986 --> 00:55:03.986
on here and regardless what go

00:55:04.822 --> 00:55:07.525
tuesday the voters, we have
jobs to do and focus on the

00:55:08.394 --> 00:55:10.495
issue and try to bring
solutions here and now.

00:55:10.963 --> 00:55:13.164
Today I will vote in the
affirmative to give voters a

00:55:15.534 --> 00:55:18.102
chance to let know how they too
feel on this issue.
Thank you.

00:55:19.304 --> 00:55:21.380
>> thank you supervisor stefani.
Supervisor melgar.

00:55:22.273 --> 00:55:23.807
>> thank you very much
PRESIDENT Peskin.

00:55:24.477 --> 00:55:26.477
And thank you to all my

00:55:29.415 --> 00:55:32.160
colleagues for a very robust
discussion and supervisor

00:55:32.117 --> 00:55:33.451
dorsey and safai for their
efforts.

00:55:37.355 --> 00:55:39.156
I will also be voting yes on
this measure.

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.280
But I want to say a up couple
things about it, because it is

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.500
not an ideal situation.

00:55:49.502 --> 00:55:52.437
My issues with both the
original measure and the

00:55:54.139 --> 00:55:56.139
amended measure is that we are

00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.900
missing a big opportunity that

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.120
we could actually be taking up

00:56:02.315 --> 00:56:04.315
in our roles as an oversight

00:56:06.752 --> 00:56:08.752
body over this department and

00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:12.189
so, I will support the argument

00:56:14.326 --> 00:56:16.326
that we are under-staffedism.

00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:19.731
I know in district 7, ingleside

00:56:20.767 --> 00:56:22.767
park and taravel are very under

00:56:23.236 --> 00:56:25.837
staffed and we have lost beat
officers, we have lost the

00:56:26.139 --> 00:56:28.139
opportunity for community

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.609
policing, we have lost a lot of
things that effect the day to

00:56:33.713 --> 00:56:36.515
day quality of life for our
residents.
I think both downtown our bred

00:56:37.884 --> 00:56:40.419
and better in terms of tax
revenue and the neighborhoods

00:56:40.987 --> 00:56:42.987
should be safe.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.459
I think low income communities
which bear the brunt of crime

00:56:47.527 --> 00:56:50.462
should be safe.
I think everything should be

00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:53.431
staffed properly both the

00:56:56.436 --> 00:56:59.710
police and 911 operators and
healthcare professionals and
everyone who makes up the

00:57:04.644 --> 00:57:06.178
safety net to have a society
that functions.

00:57:08.649 --> 00:57:11.417
Just before the break we
approved a settlement of nearly

00:57:19.425 --> 00:57:21.425
half million dollars to officer

00:57:22.395 --> 00:57:24.697
who sued the police department
who discrimination because he

00:57:27.134 --> 00:57:29.134
is a muslim.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:32.271
We approved multiple
settlements because police

00:57:32.573 --> 00:57:34.573
officers were gay and because

00:57:34.908 --> 00:57:36.908
they were women and I think it

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.945
is in the 21 century police
force that responds to the

00:57:42.816 --> 00:57:44.518
needs of the very diverse and
rich community like san

00:57:46.487 --> 00:57:49.322
francisco, which is a
international destination that

00:57:49.323 --> 00:57:51.323
welcomes tourists from

00:57:51.959 --> 00:57:54.661
everywhere in the world that
speak multiple languages, that

00:57:54.762 --> 00:57:57.563
bring multiple life
experiences, we need a police

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.650
department that is diverse,

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.670
that has language capacity.

00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:07.139
Our chief has-it is goal to

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.420
have 30 percent women by 2030.

00:58:10.344 --> 00:58:12.746
A goal I whole hearted lee
support.
I think we are missing the

00:58:12.746 --> 00:58:14.746
opportunity to help the

00:58:15.983 --> 00:58:17.983
department meet the goals we

00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:22.622
all agree on by putting some

00:58:23.391 --> 00:58:25.926
accountability along with the
increased staffing needs and

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.610
so, I think that that's

00:58:29.197 --> 00:58:31.965
something that neither one of
these versions do, but I think

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.267
the amended version gets us a
little closer to something that

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.370
I want to see, which is better

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.640
staffing on my side of town, so

00:58:41.943 --> 00:58:43.943
for that, I will be voting yes

00:58:45.179 --> 00:58:47.882
on this, and I hope that
collectively we take up our

00:58:47.882 --> 00:58:49.882
responsibility to make sure

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.180
that this police department can

00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:55.488
recruit and hold on to police

00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:59.393
force that is diverse and
responds to the needs of the

00:59:00.428 --> 00:59:02.764
community as they are now and
as they will be increasing in
the future.

00:59:02.764 --> 00:59:04.764
Thank you.

Today I would like to invite

our in-home service workers up
to the podium.

01:01:53.771 --> 01:01:55.771

01:02:05.249 --> 01:02:07.417
Colleagues, NOVEMBER is
national family care-giver

01:02:07.785 --> 01:02:10.387
month and I'm delighted to have
the opportunity today to

01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:14.423
highlight a truly exceptional

01:02:14.959 --> 01:02:17.894
role and invaluable work of
in-home supportive work
providers.

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:23.268
We are fortunate to have 26
thousand dedicated in-home

01:02:23.268 --> 01:02:25.903
supportive service providers in
san francisco who do the

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.273
essential work of delivering
high quality care for our

01:02:31.509 --> 01:02:33.509
seniors and low income

01:02:34.812 --> 01:02:37.781
residents and the majority of
in-home care givers are women

01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:42.853
of color and immigrants who
themselves often struggle

01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:44.855
financially to provide these
essential services.

01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:49.260
Their care and compassion
insures our seniors and people

01:02:50.428 --> 01:02:53.130
with disabilities can live with
dignity and independence in

01:02:53.364 --> 01:02:56.232
comfort of their home and age
in place in the communities

01:02:56.634 --> 01:02:58.634
they live and thrive in.

01:02:59.137 --> 01:03:01.606
That is why it is so important
to recognize their work, but

01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:04.641
also continue our advocacy to

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:07.211
support these workers and honor
their service by making sure

01:03:07.979 --> 01:03:09.979
they can afford to live in the

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:12.482
communities they work in.

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:15.170
I will have a resolution on

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:17.588
today's imperative agenda to
honor in-home supportive

01:03:19.558 --> 01:03:21.893
service providers and declare
today in-home supportive

01:03:22.894 --> 01:03:24.894
service providers day and I

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:28.432
urge for your support, but we
also have them here today to

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.340
accept the special recognition.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:38.543
I am trying to figure this out.

Our next special order

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.740
commendation will come from

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.360
supervisor ronan.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.974
>> if I can call the legendary

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.147
martha ryan to the podium,
please.

[Applause]

01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:23.719
Thank you.

01:10:24.555 --> 01:10:26.555
Colleagues, today I am

01:10:26.724 --> 01:10:28.724
especially honored to recognize

01:10:29.527 --> 01:10:31.661
the visionary and inspirational
leader, martha ryan.

01:10:32.964 --> 01:10:35.933
Founder and executive director
emeritus of homeless prenatal
program.

01:10:37.936 --> 01:10:39.936
In the more then 30 years since

01:10:42.707 --> 01:10:45.208
it has begun, hpp has assisted
more then hundred thousand

01:10:45.776 --> 01:10:48.545
families to deliver healthy
drug free babies and break the

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.712
cycle of paunchty.

01:10:51.616 --> 01:10:54.585
Hpp is a shining example of a
program that really works and

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.860
profoundly transformed the

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.590
trajectory of countless lives.

01:11:01.559 --> 01:11:03.559
The story of hpp begain in the

01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:06.629
1980 after serving as the peace

01:11:10.869 --> 01:11:12.869
corp volunteer in-returned to

01:11:14.806 --> 01:11:16.806
africa to work as a nurse.

01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:20.110
In those camps martha witnessed
the importance of investing in

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120
communities of empowering women

01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:26.317
and providing comprehensive
support beyond medical care for

01:11:26.552 --> 01:11:29.870
struggling families.
When she returned she was

01:11:29.822 --> 01:11:31.923
shocked by the poverty she
found at home thin san

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:34.458
francisco bay area.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.360
Sadly that poverty still exists
today.

01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:39.950
While working at the southeast

01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:41.931
health center in the bayview

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.330
district, one mentor and secret

01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:46.403
between us, his name might be

01:11:47.306 --> 01:11:49.507
DR. Dan, just throwing that in
there, the medical director at

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.110
the time of healthcare for the

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:55.947
homeless told her shockingly
there were women in the shelter

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.810
who were homeless and pregnant

01:11:58.116 --> 01:12:00.116
who were not getting any

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.256
appropriate care.
Martha in disbelief agreed to

01:12:03.256 --> 01:12:05.957
take a look.
When she got thoothe shelter

01:12:06.392 --> 01:12:09.930
she found a room with mats
lined up against the wall and

01:12:09.495 --> 01:12:11.495
three women at different stages

01:12:11.597 --> 01:12:13.498
of pregnancy but not one was
getting care.

01:12:14.533 --> 01:12:16.501
People would say that is
terrible, but nobody was doing

01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:19.237
anything about it.
Martha immediately recognized

01:12:19.506 --> 01:12:21.506
an opportunity to help.

01:12:21.741 --> 01:12:24.510
She knew these women needed
critical support, safe housing,

01:12:24.911 --> 01:12:27.145
prenatal care and a healthy
diet and that pregnancy could

01:12:28.447 --> 01:12:30.447
be a window of opportunity to

01:12:30.682 --> 01:12:32.650
change the direction of a
family's life.

01:12:33.786 --> 01:12:35.786
Martha secured a grant from san

01:12:35.922 --> 01:12:38.358
francisco foundation for $52
thousand and launched the

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:40.358
homeless prenatal project out

01:12:40.894 --> 01:12:42.227
of a empty closet at a family
shelter.

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.299
In the first year, hpp served
72 clients.

01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:52.203
34 years later under martha's
visionary leadership, hpp is a

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600
revered and celebrated program

01:12:55.142 --> 01:12:57.710
that has consistenly improved
and are expanded services that

01:12:58.912 --> 01:13:01.680
has a $17 million budget and
serves more then 3500 families

01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:04.115
per year.

01:13:04.384 --> 01:13:06.384
Hpp is widely recognized as a

01:13:07.553 --> 01:13:09.553
beacon and national model.

01:13:11.694 --> 01:13:12.953
Hpp two generational approach
works upstream to help the

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:15.394
cycle of family and childhood
poverty.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:19.165
Success lies in marthas belief
to improve life for children

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.900
you must see the strength and

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:25.300
ability of their parents by
investing and empower to

01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:27.942
overcome their challenges.
Without that empowerment the

01:13:27.942 --> 01:13:29.942
children are the next

01:13:30.678 --> 01:13:32.612
generation in the pipeline of
chronic homelessness.

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:36.282
Martha vision of empowerment
includes tapping into strengths

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:40.850
and potential of her incredible

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.421
staff and listening to ideas
from staff who life experience

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:45.990
tell them what the clients need.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.760
Over 50 percent and this is

01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:51.531
truly remarkable figure of hpp
staff are former clients from

01:13:52.967 --> 01:13:55.602
the communities that the
organization serves.

01:13:56.236 --> 01:13:58.236
Martha, we are just in ah of

01:13:58.539 --> 01:14:01.730
you, we are so proud of you.
I want to thank you from the

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:04.378
bottom of my heart for your
incredible contribution to

01:14:04.879 --> 01:14:07.181
health, happiness and wellbeing
of countless children and

01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:09.749
families.
I'm getting the chills just

01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.819
saying these words.
You have made san francisco and

01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:17.123
the world a better place,
absolutely, no question.

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:21.528
Thanks to your life of service,
activism, determination and

01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:24.497
love, hpp will continue to

01:14:25.233 --> 01:14:27.134
prosper and be a beacon of home
for generations to come.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.935
Thank you.
[Applause]

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:37.143
>> thank you.
>> before you speak we have

01:14:37.546 --> 01:14:39.180
colleagues who want to say a
few words.

01:14:40.915 --> 01:14:42.583
I'll turn it over to supervisor
walton through the chair.

01:14:44.853 --> 01:14:47.754
>> thank you so much supervisor
ronan and I just have to take

01:14:49.624 --> 01:14:51.624
the time to speak about martha

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:56.310
briefly and I don't think you
are fully retired,

01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:58.399
[Laughter]
And I'm not speaking just

01:14:59.968 --> 01:15:01.968
because you were redistricting

01:15:02.537 --> 01:15:04.537
out of district 10, but because

01:15:06.808 --> 01:15:08.877
since my early days at family
resource center director I had

01:15:08.877 --> 01:15:11.478
the opportunity to watch you,
work with you and just see the

01:15:12.381 --> 01:15:14.381
commitment that you put into

01:15:15.317 --> 01:15:17.952
making sure that families and
mothers were able to receive

01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:20.286
the support that they needed

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:23.724
and you have done it for so
many years.

01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:29.263
Most proud about the
reactivation of jalana house

01:15:29.598 --> 01:15:31.598
and bayview and the way you

01:15:32.101 --> 01:15:34.735
were able to find a place for
young and expecting mothers to

01:15:36.105 --> 01:15:38.839
live and be safe and also the
fact you were able to purchase

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.740
a building and we work to make

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.244
sure it will be hundred percent
affordable housing.

01:15:45.414 --> 01:15:47.414
I think that is just a perfect

01:15:50.152 --> 01:15:52.152
way to move forward and pass on

01:15:53.522 --> 01:15:55.690
leadership to shalina and want
to say thank you so much for

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.825
all your work and continued
work with hpp.

01:15:58.594 --> 01:16:01.329
Thank you for demonstrating and
being a example.

01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:04.498
>> thank you.
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin

01:16:05.735 --> 01:16:08.470
and thank you supervisor ronan
for this amazing honoree before

01:16:09.538 --> 01:16:11.538
us today.

01:16:11.674 --> 01:16:14.376
I'm so incredibly lucky to know
martha ryan and I remember when

01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:18.246
we first met, I nicknamed you
right away, saint martha,

01:16:19.782 --> 01:16:22.550
because I was just in ah of
everything you were doing and I

01:16:22.952 --> 01:16:25.487
was lucky enough to be able to
serve on the board of directors

01:16:25.888 --> 01:16:27.888
of the homeless prenatal

01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:31.125
program for 6 years and I
remember even having my

01:16:31.928 --> 01:16:34.262
daughter at the time, I bring
her to the meetings and have

01:16:37.266 --> 01:16:40.100
her in the pushing her around
and having babies at the

01:16:40.603 --> 01:16:42.838
homeless prenatal program is
something you did.

01:16:44.107 --> 01:16:46.575
Those 6 years I served on the
homeless prenatal program board

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.181
taught me so much, and they
taught me the -- what incredible

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:58.319
non profit can do and profound

01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:00.521
impact non profit like yours

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.991
can have on our most pressing

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560
issues, and it all most seems

01:17:06.196 --> 01:17:08.997
so effortless in terms of you
wanted to do something, we need

01:17:09.866 --> 01:17:11.866
the money and the money would

01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:14.469
appear and there was like it is
martha.

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.373
Or, you want to do family
planning.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.509
Then it happens and martha
figured it out.

01:17:22.412 --> 01:17:24.800
I felt like sometimes she was a
board member.

01:17:24.715 --> 01:17:26.549
We are supposed to question the
executive director.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:30.419
I was like whatever martha
says, I think she can make it
happen.

01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:34.580
I was probably one of the board
members that just absolutely

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.580
fallowed your lead, but

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.360
believed in you and saw every

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:40.529
vision you had became realty

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:43.198
and it just grows and grows

01:17:44.735 --> 01:17:47.136
like supervisor walton was
mentioning.
The building next door and how

01:17:48.472 --> 01:17:50.807
you want to do housing and it
is just-what I most remember

01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:01.751
too is being at the our house
fund racers in MAY and the

01:18:02.453 --> 01:18:04.787
people you touch and lives you
turn around and just watching

01:18:05.589 --> 01:18:07.589
how they grow and what happens

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:10.393
to their children and of course

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:13.950
my grood friend latifa simon

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.320
and how she was once served.

01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:19.936
I remember we figured out she
had been served by hpp and I

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.606
was on the board and in the
same class.

01:18:24.943 --> 01:18:26.943
It is magic what you do and I

01:18:27.345 --> 01:18:29.345
will continue to be in ah of it

01:18:31.482 --> 01:18:33.482
and learn from it and just in

01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:36.786
such gratitude for quhoo who
you are and all the lives you

01:18:37.188 --> 01:18:39.188
made a difference in and we

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.659
have a incredible new executive
director and can't wait to

01:18:44.196 --> 01:18:46.897
continue to work with homeless
prenatal program but martha

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.800
there are not enough words to

01:18:51.336 --> 01:18:53.503
say how amazing you and a
impact you had on my life so

01:18:54.339 --> 01:18:56.173
thank you so much for just
being incredible.

01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:59.243
>> thank you.
>> supervisor preston.

01:18:59.243 --> 01:19:02.146
[Applause]
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:05.150
and thank you colleagues for

01:19:06.451 --> 01:19:08.451
all your words and for

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.720
supervisor ronan for the real

01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:14.358
summary of incredible inspiring
work of martha.

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:17.590
I just learned I didn't realize

01:19:17.363 --> 01:19:19.764
the building had been
redistricted out of d10.

01:19:19.998 --> 01:19:21.998
I was over here.

01:19:22.201 --> 01:19:24.535
I'm still sad because martha's
personal residents was

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.340
redistricted out of d5, so

01:19:33.378 --> 01:19:35.378
no -- but, I just want to add my

01:19:38.283 --> 01:19:40.283
thanks to you for your

01:19:40.285 --> 01:19:42.285
incredible creativity, your

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:44.988
optimism, your years and years

01:19:45.757 --> 01:19:48.459
of service to the city and
really inspiring so many other

01:19:49.494 --> 01:19:51.494
efforts, not just at hpp but

01:19:54.867 --> 01:19:57.535
everything from our work at the
oasis and your history of

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.773
showing how you can make the
impossible happen with the kind

01:20:03.242 --> 01:20:05.242
of commitment and the kind of

01:20:05.778 --> 01:20:07.778
deep respect you have for folks

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.816
who are struggling and for
always centering the needs of

01:20:11.384 --> 01:20:13.384
those who are struggling the

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:15.820
most in our city, so I just

01:20:16.522 --> 01:20:18.457
want to thank you for all your
incredible work.

01:20:19.959 --> 01:20:22.227
>> thank you.
>> it is your turn now.

01:20:24.129 --> 01:20:26.129
>> it is my turn.

01:20:26.398 --> 01:20:28.398
Thank you very much supervisor

01:20:28.968 --> 01:20:30.968
ronan and all the supervisors

01:20:32.672 --> 01:20:34.672
and catherine for your service

01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:37.174
on the hpp board for 6 years.

01:20:37.977 --> 01:20:39.977
I remember that time well.

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:43.949
Hpp started in a closet in a
shelter and it grew, it has

01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:46.666
grown into a institution in san
francisco.

01:20:47.354 --> 01:20:49.354
That happens not because of one

01:20:49.556 --> 01:20:51.556
person, that happens because of

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.493
a team of committed people
working together to make change

01:20:55.728 --> 01:20:58.597
and some of my team, a very
small portion of my team, some

01:20:59.932 --> 01:21:02.670
had to leave and some-many are
still working now, but I like

01:21:02.769 --> 01:21:05.438
them to join me up here,
because it is they that

01:21:09.876 --> 01:21:11.876
actually make the magic happen.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.480
[Applause]

01:21:18.785 --> 01:21:20.785
I just want to say that the

01:21:22.423 --> 01:21:24.423
strategy as supervisor ronan

01:21:24.992 --> 01:21:26.659
mentioned has been a two
generational approach.

01:21:27.194 --> 01:21:29.194
We believe in helping mothers

01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:32.630
and if you can help -- in order

01:21:33.766 --> 01:21:35.934
for the mom to have healthy
babies and children to grow,

01:21:36.403 --> 01:21:38.671
you cannot just help the
mothers and cannot just help

01:21:38.739 --> 01:21:40.739
the babies and children, you

01:21:43.343 --> 01:21:45.343
must help the mothers and so

01:21:46.613 --> 01:21:49.315
the children can thrive and
have obtain critical needs.

01:21:51.752 --> 01:21:53.719
One of those critical needs is
housing.

01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:56.957
Buse we don't see families on
the street, that doesn't mean

01:21:57.725 --> 01:21:59.759
that there are no homeless
families.

01:22:00.327 --> 01:22:02.596
i guarantee you there are
children learning to crawl in

01:22:02.596 --> 01:22:05.164
cars.
I was talking to a staff member

01:22:06.967 --> 01:22:08.967
before I left here and she was

01:22:10.838 --> 01:22:12.838
doing a group with some

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740
postpartum moms and was saying

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:18.430
so many clients that she says 7

01:22:18.279 --> 01:22:20.279
out of 10 are homeless and I

01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:22.281
said what kind of homelessness

01:22:22.316 --> 01:22:25.118
and she said, they are living
in single room occupancy hotels.

01:22:27.621 --> 01:22:29.756
We all know those are rooms
without a restroom, without a

01:22:30.725 --> 01:22:32.593
kitchen and it is for the
entire family grows.

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:37.630
It is no fit for growing family.

01:22:38.366 --> 01:22:41.201
And we do believe in upstream
work and we need to-we believe

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:44.770
if you go upstream you got to

01:22:45.272 --> 01:22:47.272
figure out what it is that is

01:22:49.513 --> 01:22:51.712
causing families to fall into
homelessness and poverty and
try to figure it out.

01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:55.515
I guarantee you if we don't do

01:22:55.783 --> 01:22:57.783
that that the next generation

01:22:59.654 --> 01:23:01.654
and possibly the next two

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.259
generations of chronically
homeless children, chronically

01:23:05.294 --> 01:23:07.294
homeless adults are in the

01:23:08.196 --> 01:23:10.364
pipeline now and we cannot let
that happen.

01:23:12.167 --> 01:23:14.167
I really challenge all of you

01:23:14.469 --> 01:23:16.970
here on the board of
supervisors to advocate for

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:20.641
family housing.
Housing is foundational.

01:23:21.476 --> 01:23:23.476
Nothing happens without housing.

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:25.713
Families tell us over and over
again, how do we expect

01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:28.810
families to make it if they

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:30.150
don't have a place to live?

01:23:31.987 --> 01:23:34.655
We can do better and h prks p
you're right, yes we did

01:23:35.223 --> 01:23:37.223
purchase that building next

01:23:38.426 --> 01:23:40.426
door to us and on 18th street

01:23:40.896 --> 01:23:42.896
in district 9 and what an ideal

01:23:44.533 --> 01:23:46.869
place to be able to make change.
To house and support families

01:23:46.869 --> 01:23:48.869
in need.

01:23:49.938 --> 01:23:51.938
to help them exit poverty and

01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:54.841
help them exit homelessness.

01:23:56.812 --> 01:23:59.681
Sadly, it does not appear that
families are priority and I

01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:03.718
want you all to please hear
that.

01:24:04.653 --> 01:24:06.653
We would be nothing if I did

01:24:07.824 --> 01:24:09.157
not listen to the families we
serve.

01:24:11.326 --> 01:24:12.693
We need to advocate for
families.

01:24:14.764 --> 01:24:17.199
Now, I have retired, I really
have retired and it really

01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:20.902
gives me the upmost pleasure to
introduce to you today the

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.770
woman who you will see a lot of

01:24:24.707 --> 01:24:27.175
because she is a incredible
woman and advocate.

01:24:28.978 --> 01:24:31.913
She is smart, she cares, she is
committed and she does not give

01:24:40.423 --> 01:24:42.924
up when it comes to serving
families.
Shalina estrog.

01:24:44.794 --> 01:24:46.828
>> hello board of supervisors.
[Applause]

01:24:47.296 --> 01:24:49.296
Hello, honor to be here today.

01:24:50.834 --> 01:24:52.801
Honor to formally meet many of
you.

01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:55.271
The new executive director of
homeless prenatal program.

01:24:55.839 --> 01:24:57.839
I want you all to know this

01:24:58.741 --> 01:25:00.741
work we do is real and very

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.178
near and dear to my heart as a
san francisco native and as

01:25:05.181 --> 01:25:07.717
someone who has had a family
member many family members go

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.510
through hpp program.

01:25:10.187 --> 01:25:12.187
I know exactly what it means to

01:25:12.322 --> 01:25:14.924
be a sf resident and need
services and so I plan to

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:16.425
continue the work martha has
done.

01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:21.729
I think it is very easy for me

01:25:23.633 --> 01:25:25.633
to-not easy, easy to follow in

01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:28.505
martha footsteps.
I don't feel it is filling in

01:25:28.505 --> 01:25:30.840
martha's shoes because you
cannot do that.

01:25:31.675 --> 01:25:34.510
How do we work and partner
together as a community, as

01:25:35.545 --> 01:25:37.981
families, as our staff to make
a difference in the lives of

01:25:37.981 --> 01:25:39.981
families and martha said, we

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:42.652
have work to do, so you will be
seeing me and hope we can

01:25:42.653 --> 01:25:44.989
partner together and make a
difference for our families in

01:25:44.989 --> 01:25:47.890
the city.
>> we look forward to it.

01:25:47.524 --> 01:25:49.524
Thank you and congratulations.

01:25:50.994 --> 01:25:52.862
>> thank you very much.
[Applause]

01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:56.731
>> last but not least, we will

01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:01.904
go to district 11 supervisor

01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:09.179
ahsha safai.
>> thank you colleagues.

01:26:12.316 --> 01:26:14.717
Today it truly is my honor.
I guess I'm getting old.

01:26:15.519 --> 01:26:18.221
I have been in this city long
enough I have known someone

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.424
over and worked with them over

01:26:22.426 --> 01:26:24.426
20 years.

01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:27.363
It really is deep deep honor of

01:26:27.565 --> 01:26:30.400
mine to honor the incredible
legacy of joe martinez.

01:26:32.369 --> 01:26:35.105
Joe, if you could come forward.
The founder and until recently

01:26:35.907 --> 01:26:37.907
the executive director of

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440
mission child care consortium.

01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:45.282
Joe martinez was born in new
mexico, 1948 but been a long

01:26:47.618 --> 01:26:49.452
time san francisco resident and
community leader.

01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:53.990
He began working at the age of

01:26:54.559 --> 01:26:56.559
14 and when he was 17 year old

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.628
part of the youth group called

01:26:58.897 --> 01:27:01.398
the mission rebels in the
mission district.

01:27:03.401 --> 01:27:06.103
This group helped train
teenagers obtain jobs.

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:09.710
A few years later he started

01:27:10.275 --> 01:27:12.275
working at mission language

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.460
vocational school, mlvs and
continue service to community

01:27:16.181 --> 01:27:17.814
and commitment to help people
find jobs.

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.950
We are starting to see a theme.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.319
Joe at a young age giving the

01:27:23.555 --> 01:27:25.555
people, helping people.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:31.661
On NOVEMBER 2, 1970 mayor joe

01:27:31.964 --> 01:27:33.931
alioto appointed to the mission
model corporation a critical

01:27:36.268 --> 01:27:38.268
group in the mission community

01:27:38.904 --> 01:27:40.671
tasked with formulating ideas,
identifying priorities and

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.140
setting goals to benefit and

01:27:44.477 --> 01:27:46.477
uplifting the communities of

01:27:46.779 --> 01:27:48.880
san francisco and joe's case
particularly he was the

01:27:49.414 --> 01:27:51.516
youngest board of directors
member representing the mission

01:27:53.385 --> 01:27:55.385
community at the time.

01:27:55.888 --> 01:27:57.888
In 1978 joe received his degree

01:27:58.357 --> 01:28:00.900
in social services from san
francisco city college.

01:28:01.259 --> 01:28:03.895
He continued to go to school at
san francisco state and the

01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:06.830
university of san francisco and

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.100
he decided on serving families

01:28:10.269 --> 01:28:12.269
and infants and toddlers.

01:28:12.971 --> 01:28:14.972
His vision was to create a
culturally competent learning

01:28:16.174 --> 01:28:18.943
environment for children when
led to consolidate 5 child care

01:28:19.812 --> 01:28:22.247
centers into one facility in
the mission district, which was

01:28:23.916 --> 01:28:25.317
the birth of mission child care
consortium.

01:28:26.285 --> 01:28:28.285
I think at the time and this

01:28:28.421 --> 01:28:30.421
isn't part of the off script,

01:28:31.624 --> 01:28:33.558
but at the time it was a old
funeral home so joe had to

01:28:34.493 --> 01:28:37.262
convince all the families it
would be okay to be in a

01:28:39.232 --> 01:28:41.633
building where there had been
formally dead bodies.

01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:46.271
Joe, met with every single
family member and convinced

01:28:48.474 --> 01:28:50.409
them the spirits would be on
their side.

01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:53.845
Joe continued to seek another
facility to provide child care

01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:57.816
development for the over 200
children being served now in

01:28:58.618 --> 01:29:00.618
this child care facility who

01:29:01.354 --> 01:29:04.900
needed to go to work, attend
school or continue the training

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.425
in their life.
His vision and early commitment

01:29:07.493 --> 01:29:09.493
was to provide more jobs for

01:29:09.762 --> 01:29:12.598
the community as child care
providers, but also child care

01:29:13.467 --> 01:29:15.935
opportunities so people could
continue to advance and then

01:29:17.838 --> 01:29:19.939
training for his staff which he
absolutely accomplished above

01:29:22.409 --> 01:29:23.987
and beyond many people at that
time.

01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:28.790
In 1987, he found a building a

01:29:29.116 --> 01:29:30.816
former electrical facility,
electrical workshop, 4750

01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:33.986
mission street out in the
excelsior, and embarked on

01:29:34.321 --> 01:29:37.123
effort to secure that building
to remodel it and turn it into

01:29:37.758 --> 01:29:39.758
a child care facility.

01:29:40.293 --> 01:29:42.293
This building is 25 thousand

01:29:42.863 --> 01:29:44.797
square feet so it is a really
large facility.

01:29:45.599 --> 01:29:47.599
At the time and I'll say this,

01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:50.690
I think zoe was a visionary, he

01:29:50.437 --> 01:29:52.806
was committed to securing
sufficient space that not only

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.400
provide child care and also

01:29:55.409 --> 01:29:57.409
able to feed families because

01:29:57.811 --> 01:29:59.811
there was a-he put in a kitchen

01:29:59.947 --> 01:30:02.248
and facility that could serve
food to families that were in

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:05.830
need, so he was ahead of his

01:30:06.454 --> 01:30:08.454
time again on the issue of food

01:30:08.489 --> 01:30:11.350
insecurity and he saw so many
families dealing with at the
time.

01:30:11.759 --> 01:30:13.759
Freshly made food was a big

01:30:13.828 --> 01:30:16.329
deal for joe and as we know,
this has become a big part of

01:30:16.697 --> 01:30:18.697
what we tried to provide here

01:30:19.566 --> 01:30:22.469
in the city and county of san
francisco.
Additionally, wanted to insure

01:30:22.637 --> 01:30:24.637
a playground for the children

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.800
to enjoy outdoors, so in 1992,

01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:31.478
they officially opened mission
child care consortium and

01:30:32.513 --> 01:30:34.513
throughout his leadership joe

01:30:34.615 --> 01:30:36.583
continued to secure partnership
with mayor office, children

01:30:36.884 --> 01:30:38.884
youth and families to extend

01:30:40.922 --> 01:30:43.624
child care and preschool slots
and at the time of his

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.894
retirement which was just
recently, he served mission

01:30:50.631 --> 01:30:53.233
child care for 42 years at the
mission child care consortium.

01:30:54.535 --> 01:30:57.371
It st. Now in 52 year of
operation with over 220

01:30:57.572 --> 01:31:00.341
children.
It the largest private child

01:31:00.975 --> 01:31:03.777
care facility in the entire
city and county of san

01:31:05.246 --> 01:31:07.246
francisco outside the unified

01:31:08.783 --> 01:31:10.783
school district facilities.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.860
Thank goodness he continued his

01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:16.190
vision and advocacy for
development service because

01:31:16.625 --> 01:31:18.625
before he retired he achieved

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:20.928
the goal of helping mission
child care buy their building

01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:23.464
and if they had not bought
their building prior to covid,

01:31:24.966 --> 01:31:26.933
they would have absolutely gone
out of business.

01:31:28.503 --> 01:31:30.503
When I met joe and this is why

01:31:31.105 --> 01:31:33.741
I started my speech 20 years
ago I made a commitment to him

01:31:34.476 --> 01:31:37.445
when working with mayor newsom
we would help him buy the
building.

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.800
At the time they were paying

01:31:40.282 --> 01:31:42.282
$25 thousand a month in rent.

01:31:42.817 --> 01:31:45.652
Just in rent for their space.
It seemed crazy they couldn't

01:31:47.956 --> 01:31:49.724
take the mun money and put it
into a mortgage.

01:31:50.326 --> 01:31:52.326
I didn't accomplish it when I

01:31:52.761 --> 01:31:54.761
worked for the mayor but when I

01:31:55.364 --> 01:31:57.364
elected as supervisor we were

01:31:57.599 --> 01:31:59.599
able to finalize with mayor lee

01:31:59.735 --> 01:32:01.969
the ribbon cutting and helping
them buy their building and

01:32:04.172 --> 01:32:06.273
that was due to joe tenacity
and determination.

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.377
Joe I thank you for your
leadership andition have.

01:32:11.347 --> 01:32:13.748
You handed your reins to your
daughter.
She isn't as cranky in the

01:32:16.552 --> 01:32:19.187
morning as you are.
[Laughter]
But she loves children, loves

01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:22.490
the community and just as
committed as you are and handed

01:32:23.325 --> 01:32:24.659
the torch to a phenomenal
person.

01:32:25.361 --> 01:32:27.996
It really is my honor as your
friend, someone that worked

01:32:29.165 --> 01:32:31.601
with you over 20 years to honor
mission child care for the 50

01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:34.135
years they have done.
It is couple year past that

01:32:34.937 --> 01:32:36.937
time now, and honor you joe for

01:32:37.573 --> 01:32:39.874
everything you have done for
san francisco, legacy you built

01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:42.809
and the road you paved for so

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.681
many people to follow in your
footsteps.

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:48.952
Thank you.
[Applause]

01:32:48.952 --> 01:32:50.952
>> thank you.

01:32:53.523 --> 01:32:55.523
Thank you very much.

01:32:58.930 --> 01:32:59.895
How many non profits make it to
50 years?

01:33:01.698 --> 01:33:04.667
It has been a long journey.
I'm proud to have worked for

01:33:08.505 --> 01:33:10.505
mission child care for 46 years.

01:33:11.641 --> 01:33:13.641
I'm proud to know ahsha.

01:33:14.544 --> 01:33:17.413
If it wasn't -- I want to
recognize him, because him and

01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:22.170
mayor lee made it possible to

01:33:22.519 --> 01:33:25.354
be able to have mission child
care own its building.

01:33:29.926 --> 01:33:32.394
We were paying a ridiculous
amount of rent and they wanted

01:33:36.133 --> 01:33:39.100
to raise our rent more and
developer wanted to come in and

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.504
get the building.
Ahsha you and mayor lee are in

01:33:41.638 --> 01:33:43.638
my heart.

01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:48.810
I'll never forget what you and

01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.720
amendments to other sections of
the planning code to a-mind the

01:43:18.757 --> 01:43:21.258
zoning map to create priority
equity geography special use

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.760
district to amend the

01:43:26.598 --> 01:43:28.598
subdivision code to update the

01:43:31.102 --> 01:43:33.638
condo conversion requirements.
And affirm the ceqa

01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:36.340
determination and make the
appropriate finds.

01:43:36.908 --> 01:43:39.610
>> supervisor melgar, chair of
land use transportation
committee, the floor is yours.

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.581
>> thank you so much PRESIDENT
Peskin.
Colleagues, this item has

01:43:45.651 --> 01:43:48.620
gotten a lot of press over the
last few months.

01:43:49.989 --> 01:43:51.989
It has been a pretty heavy lift

01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:56.594
to work with all of the
stakeholders on a matter that

01:43:57.763 --> 01:43:59.763
pertains to the processes of

01:43:59.831 --> 01:44:01.831
our 7 by 7 square mile city

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.437
with a code that is extremely
complicated and that has

01:44:04.437 --> 01:44:06.437
evolved over time.

01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:10.241
We have been working closely
with our city attorney, the

01:44:11.277 --> 01:44:13.478
planning department, the
mayor's office and colleagues

01:44:15.514 --> 01:44:17.514
on the land use committee to

01:44:19.751 --> 01:44:22.654
come out with something that is
true to the letter of the law

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:25.256
and intent of our housing

01:44:26.492 --> 01:44:28.492
element, which we approved

01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:31.295
unanimously and also meets the

01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:34.299
technical compliance of the
various pieces of legislation

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.800
that have passed and signed

01:44:37.690 --> 01:44:39.690
into law by our governor this

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:41.540
past year and there are many
many pieces of legislation.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.211
It has been a complicated
exercise.

01:44:48.781 --> 01:44:50.781
Never the less, we were able to

01:44:51.817 --> 01:44:53.685
send this piece of the
committee report yesterday from

01:44:55.588 --> 01:44:57.990
the land use transportation
committee, however 45 minutes

01:44:59.225 --> 01:45:01.225
before the meeting started, we

01:45:01.661 --> 01:45:03.661
did get a corrective action

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:09.660
letter from the folks at the

01:45:11.303 --> 01:45:14.173
state housing development
department and it warns us

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:17.142
about one of the amendments

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.277
that we made, so it will take

01:45:21.881 --> 01:45:23.881
us a little bit of time to make

01:45:25.184 --> 01:45:27.184
sure that we pass what we bring

01:45:27.654 --> 01:45:29.821
before you is a compliant piece
of legislation.

01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:32.758
In addition, there is another

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.295
piece of legislation that
supervisor mandelman will speak

01:45:39.386 --> 01:45:41.386
about, which I think is

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:43.669
consistent with the goal of
this streamlining legislation,

01:45:45.271 --> 01:45:47.673
which is to maximize the
production of housing units if

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.176
we are adding bulk to the

01:45:51.512 --> 01:45:53.512
buildings in san francisco.

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:55.748
It is still something that is
moving.

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:59.350
I want to assure all of you

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.822
that in terms of the timing,

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.925
the first 30 day deadline that

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.365
has been made much about in the
press passed on thanksgiving

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.365
day.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:15.835
That was the day where none of
us were in the building and

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:19.771
none of the staff at hcd were

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:22.307
in their building, so we heard

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:24.342
this at the very earliest

01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:27.279
possible date, which was past

01:46:29.917 --> 01:46:32.719
the deadline and that was on it
27th.
It requires them to issue a

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.321
corrective action letter which
they did 45 minutes ago and we

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.425
have 30 days to correct, so if

01:46:40.795 --> 01:46:42.795
we vote on it today, or next

01:46:43.398 --> 01:46:45.398
week that is still leaves us

01:46:46.501 --> 01:46:48.501
with the meetings on the 5th

01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:50.569
and the 12th to vote on

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.807
something and still have a good
two weeks before the deadline

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:55.909
for the corrective action
compliance.

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.910
I just want to make sure that

01:46:59.948 --> 01:47:02.850
we all understand that we are
within the timeframe, we are

01:47:04.619 --> 01:47:06.619
cutting it close, however, this

01:47:06.888 --> 01:47:08.888
is a complicated city with

01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:11.290
buildings that share lot lines

01:47:11.893 --> 01:47:13.893
with a very long and rich

01:47:15.397 --> 01:47:17.397
history of land use struggles,

01:47:17.666 --> 01:47:20.000
and I think that I more then
anything want to thank my

01:47:20.702 --> 01:47:22.869
colleagues on the land use
transportation committee for

01:47:24.272 --> 01:47:26.272
all of the work and time that

01:47:26.674 --> 01:47:28.674
we put into it.

01:47:31.546 --> 01:47:33.848
Supervisor preston and
PRESIDENT Peskin.
Thank you very much.

01:47:34.516 --> 01:47:36.550
I'll turn it over to my
colleague supervisor mandelman.

01:47:36.685 --> 01:47:39.520
>> thank you very much.
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.

01:47:42.324 --> 01:47:44.324
I'm going to make a motion as

01:47:44.526 --> 01:47:46.526
chair melgar indicated that I

01:47:48.263 --> 01:47:50.764
likely would continue this item
one week.

01:47:51.466 --> 01:47:53.466
In her remarks chair melgar

01:47:56.105 --> 01:47:58.706
gave a couple reasons for that
continuance but I do want to

01:48:00.842 --> 01:48:02.842
thank the chair and members of

01:48:03.879 --> 01:48:05.879
the land use committee for many

01:48:05.947 --> 01:48:08.616
many meetings where they poured
through a pretty complicated

01:48:09.318 --> 01:48:11.318
piece of legislation.

01:48:14.456 --> 01:48:16.456
We are doing big things to our

01:48:16.992 --> 01:48:18.992
processes with regard to the-my

01:48:19.495 --> 01:48:22.163
reason for seeking a
continuance today, one of my

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.269
concerns about this legislation
is that potentially it could

01:48:29.872 --> 01:48:32.641
end up leading to the
streamlining of monster homes

01:48:34.143 --> 01:48:36.644
and demolition particularly in
my district.

01:48:38.647 --> 01:48:41.382
That is a concern many
supervisors had and state

01:48:42.284 --> 01:48:45.870
senator wiener and I have
sought to address those

01:48:45.555 --> 01:48:46.922
concerns through the creation
of cu's.

01:48:50.727 --> 01:48:52.727
We are in a era where we are

01:48:52.995 --> 01:48:54.995
not-trying to not have as many

01:48:56.132 --> 01:48:58.132
cu's and one of the purposes of

01:48:58.467 --> 01:49:00.467
the streamlining legislation is

01:49:04.730 --> 01:49:05.808
get rid of as many
discretionary approvals we can.

01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:09.778
I think there is a way to avoid
monster homes in central

01:49:10.113 --> 01:49:12.113
neighborhoods I represent but

01:49:12.448 --> 01:49:14.716
we need to amend the
streamlining legislation and to

01:49:15.418 --> 01:49:17.786
do that we need to send the
proposal back to planning.

01:49:18.956 --> 01:49:21.190
That proposal will be heard at
the planning commission

01:49:21.591 --> 01:49:23.591
thursday, so I think it come

01:49:24.861 --> 01:49:26.861
back to us for action as part

01:49:27.970 --> 01:49:29.970
of this approval next week, but

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:33.350
to do that I would as a matter
of collegial courtesy ask

01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:35.169
colleagues give me a week to

01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:39.442
try to get my last amendment in
shape for consideration.

01:49:40.444 --> 01:49:42.884
>> motion made to continue item
one week by supervisor

01:49:42.884 --> 01:49:44.884
mandelman.

01:49:46.349 --> 01:49:48.349
Seconded by chair melgar.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.754
To the motion, supervisor chan.
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.

01:49:54.358 --> 01:49:56.358
I am not speaking about the

01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:59.796
motion, but the legislation
itself.
I just first want to thank the

01:50:00.264 --> 01:50:02.264
land use committee for all your

01:50:02.499 --> 01:50:04.499
hard work in the last few

01:50:04.868 --> 01:50:06.868
months to really make sure this

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400
is right for san francisco in

01:50:11.342 --> 01:50:13.810
the context of trying to be
compliant to the state mandate.

01:50:15.212 --> 01:50:17.212
I do want to put in context

01:50:17.615 --> 01:50:20.383
that I think what we know about
san francisco and housing stock

01:50:21.985 --> 01:50:23.985
that we have or have not, it is

01:50:24.354 --> 01:50:26.354
the fact that we know that last

01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:29.327
year from supervisor dean
preston's request through the

01:50:29.327 --> 01:50:31.327
budget legislative analyst

01:50:33.364 --> 01:50:35.766
report that we have 40 thousand
empty home units and through

01:50:35.766 --> 01:50:37.766
the housing element process

01:50:38.836 --> 01:50:41.104
that we know we have 60
thousand approved housing units

01:50:42.473 --> 01:50:43.773
in the pipeline waiting to be
built.

01:50:47.712 --> 01:50:49.881
We know from supervisor ahsha
safai request to budget

01:50:49.881 --> 01:50:51.881
legislative analyst that we

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.160
have report that tells that we

01:50:54.351 --> 01:50:56.351
have roughly well over 300

01:50:56.554 --> 01:50:58.554
below market rate units when

01:50:58.989 --> 01:51:00.989
there are sro families living

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:03.661
in chinatown and tenderloin,
yet still cannot afford these

01:51:04.329 --> 01:51:06.329
below market rate units and be

01:51:06.665 --> 01:51:08.665
able to obtain them and move in.

01:51:08.967 --> 01:51:11.535
What we have done as a body
during this time though, which

01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:15.370
I appreciate want to express

01:51:15.273 --> 01:51:17.273
thanks to colleagues who have

01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:21.910
land use expertise, including

01:51:22.814 --> 01:51:25.783
supervisor mandelman 4-plex
legislation, supervisor melgar
family housing opportunity

01:51:27.586 --> 01:51:30.321
legislation to make sure we
build and also that west side

01:51:31.356 --> 01:51:33.356
of the city continue to build.

01:51:34.592 --> 01:51:37.361
With that, we also I think as a
city has consistently make sure

01:51:38.130 --> 01:51:40.164
and along with board
PRESIDENT-make sure we continue

01:51:40.566 --> 01:51:42.566
to build homes, that including

01:51:42.834 --> 01:51:45.269
that we recognize that 60
thousand units already approve

01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:48.339
waiting to be built.
With that is the reason why we

01:51:49.508 --> 01:51:51.508
also supported board PRESIDENT

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:58.249
Legislation to lower
inclusionary
percentage-inclusionary housing

01:51:58.484 --> 01:52:00.752
percentage to boost production.
We also put our money where our

01:52:00.752 --> 01:52:02.752
mouth is.

01:52:04.857 --> 01:52:07.559
In 2019 the city has approved a
$600 million of affordable

01:52:07.559 --> 01:52:09.559
housing bond.

01:52:09.594 --> 01:52:11.594
In fact this body again also

01:52:11.696 --> 01:52:13.696
just approve and put on the

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:16.660
MARCH ballot measure another

01:52:16.802 --> 01:52:18.303
$300 million of housing band.
Bond.

01:52:19.572 --> 01:52:21.572
We are anticipating to see 1.5

01:52:22.408 --> 01:52:24.475
$1.5 billion to come tof san
francisco alone.

01:52:25.678 --> 01:52:27.779
A regional housing bond this
coming NOVEMBER in 2024.

01:52:28.513 --> 01:52:30.648
Time and time again we are see
we are building and when I

01:52:32.185 --> 01:52:34.786
think about the 60 thousand
approve housing units waiting

01:52:35.321 --> 01:52:38.560
in the pipeline, that's not
just on one sector of the city.

01:52:39.826 --> 01:52:41.826
We know it is mission rock,

01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:46.164
treasure island but also know
there is potrero power station,

01:52:47.934 --> 01:52:49.668
there is park merced and stone
town.

01:52:52.605 --> 01:52:55.574
We are building as a city and
balboa reservoir.
Thank you supervisor melgar.

01:52:56.142 --> 01:52:58.142
We are building as a city and

01:52:59.579 --> 01:53:01.579
we are committed to build, so

01:53:01.747 --> 01:53:03.747
this optic to somehow that the

01:53:04.517 --> 01:53:06.517
city is not building I think it

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.288
is quite the contrary.
We are building, we are putting

01:53:09.689 --> 01:53:12.124
our money where our mouth is,
not just this body, not just

01:53:15.195 --> 01:53:18.130
the board of supervisors, so
are the voters.
The san francisco residents

01:53:19.666 --> 01:53:21.767
time and time again step up to
support these affordable

01:53:21.767 --> 01:53:24.170
housing bond.
What I have found though

01:53:24.671 --> 01:53:26.671
colleagues is that the state

01:53:28.241 --> 01:53:30.743
law time and time again that it
is not necessarily in the best

01:53:31.645 --> 01:53:34.246
interest of san francisco.
What I learned throughout time

01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:37.810
that especially in the most

01:53:39.452 --> 01:53:41.452
recent last few days perhaps we

01:53:41.722 --> 01:53:43.722
saw the correspondence between

01:53:44.591 --> 01:53:47.126
our planning department and the
department of housing, state

01:53:49.763 --> 01:53:52.431
department of housing
specifically about accessory
dwelling units.

01:53:54.267 --> 01:53:56.870
What I identified and in my
time in learning more about

01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:58.870
accessory dwelling units in san

01:53:59.907 --> 01:54:01.907
francisco, I see the state law

01:54:02.676 --> 01:54:04.676
is really driven by developers

01:54:05.245 --> 01:54:07.245
and realtors when it comes to

01:54:07.581 --> 01:54:09.315
state law governing around
accessory dwelling units and

01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:11.950
let me give you a example.

01:54:13.186 --> 01:54:15.186
State law in fact prohibit san

01:54:15.623 --> 01:54:17.623
francisco to install sprinkler

01:54:17.725 --> 01:54:19.725
system in our accessory

01:54:20.861 --> 01:54:23.463
dwelling units and that that
again is fascinating to me that

01:54:24.532 --> 01:54:26.532
in the time when we have to

01:54:26.667 --> 01:54:29.469
deal with wild fire and
learning lessens from maui, we

01:54:31.605 --> 01:54:33.605
are yet not being able to

01:54:33.975 --> 01:54:36.676
install sprinkler system in our
accessory dwelling units.

01:54:37.511 --> 01:54:39.511
The same correspondence I

01:54:40.314 --> 01:54:42.314
learned there is also questions

01:54:42.617 --> 01:54:44.617
about what I consider collapse

01:54:45.586 --> 01:54:47.586
zone, meaning we should allow

01:54:50.592 --> 01:54:53.600
space in our rear yard that for
access redwell ing units in

01:54:53.628 --> 01:54:55.628
rear yard to allow collapse

01:54:55.997 --> 01:54:57.997
zone in the event of earthquake.

01:54:58.232 --> 01:55:00.232
These are as I'm told

01:55:00.268 --> 01:55:02.268
especially the sprinkler system

01:55:02.803 --> 01:55:04.237
instillation is cost
prohibitive.

01:55:04.939 --> 01:55:06.939
Therefore it is not allowed to

01:55:07.978 --> 01:55:10.444
be installed for these
accessory dwelling units by
state law.

01:55:11.813 --> 01:55:13.813
That brings the question that

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.918
so, cost prohibitive that means
profit over fire and earthquake

01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:20.120
safety and those are the
questions I continue to have

01:55:21.522 --> 01:55:23.522
about the state laws that are

01:55:23.591 --> 01:55:25.759
imposed upon us today and from
now on.

01:55:27.930 --> 01:55:29.930
Quhile while I appreciate our

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.600
city attorney david chui former

01:55:32.634 --> 01:55:34.634
assembly member, also the state

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:36.970
assembly members at the state

01:55:38.272 --> 01:55:39.973
assembly as our chair of
housing committee that come

01:55:42.176 --> 01:55:44.545
with a lot of expertise around
housing policy both not just in

01:55:45.781 --> 01:55:47.915
san francisco, but also in the
state of california.

01:55:49.551 --> 01:55:52.190
I too really am hoping that now
as our city attorney that he

01:55:52.387 --> 01:55:54.387
will fight for us and defend us

01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:56.690
in the best interest of san
franciscanss.

01:55:57.959 --> 01:56:00.600
The reason why a cosponsor
resolution urging him and his

01:56:01.630 --> 01:56:03.630
office to make sure that we in

01:56:03.265 --> 01:56:05.265
the best interest of san

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.340
francisco generally defend our

01:56:08.236 --> 01:56:10.838
interest and in negotiation and
conversation with the

01:56:11.907 --> 01:56:14.108
department of housing and
community development and from

01:56:14.309 --> 01:56:16.309
the state level.

01:56:17.145 --> 01:56:20.150
With that colleagues I have a
lot of skepticism with this

01:56:20.583 --> 01:56:22.583
legislation before us today,

01:56:23.486 --> 01:56:26.387
but most importantly the
continuing mandates from the

01:56:28.123 --> 01:56:30.123
state that seems to be out of

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.728
the realm of what I would
consider we have done along

01:56:33.729 --> 01:56:35.729
with housing elements and what

01:56:37.934 --> 01:56:40.302
we have already approved and we
continue to comply and we have

01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:43.738
done everything that we can
time and time again to prove

01:56:45.941 --> 01:56:48.343
that both in policy and money
that we are in the best

01:56:49.578 --> 01:56:52.480
interest of san francisco to
also comply in these state

01:56:54.551 --> 01:56:56.551
laws, but it seems like it is

01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.420
never enough and so I am just

01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:03.525
going to stop right here and
just disappointed to see how

01:57:05.695 --> 01:57:07.695
this continue to unfold that

01:57:07.796 --> 01:57:09.796
how the goal post continue to

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.835
move away from us each and
every time when we do our best

01:57:12.836 --> 01:57:14.436
to comply.
Thank you.

01:57:16.406 --> 01:57:18.407
>> thank you supervisor chan.
Supervisor dorsey.

01:57:18.474 --> 01:57:19.808
>> thank you prez dependent
peskin.

01:57:20.743 --> 01:57:22.743
I do want to clarify just for

01:57:24.113 --> 01:57:26.181
the record that as a matter of
collegeality inclined to be

01:57:26.716 --> 01:57:28.716
supportive of the continuance.

01:57:32.122 --> 01:57:35.570
If I MAY though just given the
last recent letter through the
PRESIDENT.

01:57:37.761 --> 01:57:39.761
MAY I ask the city

01:57:40.797 --> 01:57:42.797
attorney-there is a line on

01:57:42.966 --> 01:57:45.102
page 3 to safely insure the
city implements this action on

01:57:45.102 --> 01:57:47.503
time.
Hcd recommend the board of

01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:50.380
supervisors pass the ordinance

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.741
without these or additional
substantive amendments.

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:55.510
Is there anything that a

01:57:55.612 --> 01:57:57.612
continuance would do to

01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:02.518
jeopardize our compliance?
>> [Indiscernible]

01:58:03.354 --> 01:58:04.687
>> deputy city attorney ann
pierson.

01:58:05.923 --> 01:58:07.923
If you are continuing the item

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.927
today it remains in the current
form until next week and at

01:58:11.562 --> 01:58:13.764
that point if you wish to take
action on the recommendation or

01:58:13.764 --> 01:58:16.632
any action at all you still
have time to do that.

01:58:16.667 --> 01:58:19.635
>> okay.
Then I will be supporting the

01:58:20.204 --> 01:58:22.806
continuance because I know it
will pass today, but I do

01:58:23.307 --> 01:58:25.307
intend to do everything I can

01:58:26.243 --> 01:58:28.243
to make sure that we are in

01:58:28.712 --> 01:58:30.747
compliance with our obligations
under state law.

01:58:33.417 --> 01:58:35.451
I will say the bulk of my
remarks for next week when we

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.456
vote on the items, but I want
to mention just in my career

01:58:39.924 --> 01:58:42.426
and said this before, I have
seen many times when san

01:58:45.329 --> 01:58:47.329
francisco is in the cross-hairs

01:58:49.967 --> 01:58:51.868
of other governments or
oversight bodies and when we

01:58:52.102 --> 01:58:54.604
have the option of playing by
the rules I think it is good

01:58:55.774 --> 01:58:57.774
idea to do so.

01:58:58.176 --> 01:59:00.176
I rather san francisco be an

01:59:00.445 --> 01:59:02.445
example how to comply with our

01:59:04.115 --> 01:59:06.115
obligations under state law

01:59:06.284 --> 01:59:07.784
then a cautionary tale how not
to do.

01:59:08.753 --> 01:59:10.887
I want to express gratitude all
the work to people who have

01:59:12.424 --> 01:59:14.424
done a lot of the work on this.

01:59:14.893 --> 01:59:17.561
I know there is a lot of work
involved in this kind of thing

01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:20.830
from the mayor's office staff,

01:59:20.965 --> 01:59:22.933
the planning department, many
colleagues for thoughtful

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:25.969
amendmentss and engagement.
Legislative aid, madison tan,

01:59:26.571 --> 01:59:28.571
but I want to especially

01:59:28.573 --> 01:59:31.442
express gratitude to supervisor
melgar who has done a

01:59:33.445 --> 01:59:35.346
incredible job as chair of land
use committee shepherding this

01:59:38.516 --> 01:59:40.418
through and working diligently
and collaboratively with

01:59:40.518 --> 01:59:43.530
stakeholders to preserve family
housing opportunities as a

01:59:43.388 --> 01:59:45.388
special use district.

01:59:45.690 --> 01:59:47.324
As I think she said in
committee yesterday,

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:50.929
collaborative work goes
unthanked and unnoticed and I

01:59:50.996 --> 01:59:53.297
think a favorite statement you
made is that feel you are

01:59:54.466 --> 01:59:56.534
always stuck doing the dishes,
which resinated with me because

01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:59.200
I hate doing dishes.

01:59:59.171 --> 02:00:01.171
I want to acknowledge your work

02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.141
and the work of colleagues for
all of this.

02:00:06.946 --> 02:00:09.748
I will be supporting the
continuance.
>> supervisor walton.

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.552
>> thank you PRESIDENT Peskin.
I'm not sure if the question

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.520
was asked in committee, but can

02:00:17.756 --> 02:00:19.756
someone just tell why we

02:00:19.925 --> 02:00:22.228
eliminate developer fees on
certain affordable housing

02:00:22.228 --> 02:00:25.163
projects?
Knowing that these fund parks

02:00:25.965 --> 02:00:28.767
community programs and other
improvements.

02:00:28.935 --> 02:00:30.935
Is there anyone who can answer

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.440
that question for me?

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.444
Anyone who has a answer to that
question?

02:00:41.114 --> 02:00:43.114
I can look at the names of the

02:00:46.318 --> 02:00:48.318
sponsors on here.

02:00:51.457 --> 02:00:53.457
Mayor's office, supervisor

02:00:58.310 --> 02:01:00.966
engardio, -- supervisor dorsey.
Did you hear the question?

02:01:02.936 --> 02:01:04.936
Why will we be eliminating

02:01:05.338 --> 02:01:07.338
developer fees on affordable

02:01:07.473 --> 02:01:09.473
housing projects when we know

02:01:09.675 --> 02:01:11.675
they fund parks, programs and

02:01:17.617 --> 02:01:20.386
other community benefits?
I can ask a question not to the
motion.

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.920
The motion was made.

02:01:22.989 --> 02:01:24.989
That isn't how the rules go

02:01:26.192 --> 02:01:28.794
supervisor melgar, but thank
you.

02:01:30.897 --> 02:01:33.799
>> I think it is important that
we do everything we can to be

02:01:35.502 --> 02:01:37.360
in compliance with the state
hcd.

02:01:38.805 --> 02:01:40.805
i worry given some of the-this

02:01:41.274 --> 02:01:43.274
is a agency that made clear

02:01:43.576 --> 02:01:46.245
that it is not messing around
and a former colleague now the

02:01:46.513 --> 02:01:48.513
state attorney general is

02:01:48.982 --> 02:01:51.417
taking very seriously his
obligations under state law and

02:01:52.253 --> 02:01:54.253
has with other jurisdictions.

02:01:55.756 --> 02:01:58.557
This is something that I
believe is would make us

02:01:58.558 --> 02:02:00.661
compliant with state law, so I
want to make sure we are doing

02:02:00.661 --> 02:02:02.661
that.

02:02:04.898 --> 02:02:06.899
That's why I am supporting the
restraints legislation.

02:02:09.403 --> 02:02:12.272
>> just through the chair, we
have built a lot of affordable

02:02:12.439 --> 02:02:14.439
housing in district 10 and

02:02:14.475 --> 02:02:16.475
don't give up developer fees,

02:02:16.744 --> 02:02:19.313
so I would be interested to
know what are we trying to

02:02:19.313 --> 02:02:21.313
accomplish here, because

02:02:21.982 --> 02:02:23.982
housing is still being built

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.920
and so just given anything to

02:02:29.557 --> 02:02:31.557
developer makes so sense to me.

02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:33.393

02:03:34.523 --> 02:03:36.523
request of financial impact of

02:03:37.125 --> 02:03:40.610
apec of small business,
cultural institutions community
organizations residents and

02:03:40.329 --> 02:03:42.830

surrounding the security

02:03:43.698 --> 02:03:45.698
perimeter particularly in the

02:03:46.868 --> 02:03:48.868
yerba buena and moscone area.

02:03:48.903 --> 02:03:51.204
A few weeks ago supervisor chan
passed a resolution and proud

02:03:52.307 --> 02:03:54.307
to be cosponsor of that urging

02:03:54.443 --> 02:03:56.978
the mayor and city agencies to
inform residents and vulnerable

02:03:57.446 --> 02:04:00.314
communities of security
transportation and service

02:04:01.517 --> 02:04:04.510
impacts from apec activities to
prioritize city funding towards

02:04:04.486 --> 02:04:07.210
mitigation of impacts on
neighborhoods, small businesses

02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:09.923
and vulnerable communities and
protect people's rights to

02:04:11.327 --> 02:04:13.327
freedom of speech and uphold

02:04:19.468 --> 02:04:21.468
the city -- people's id's might

02:04:21.603 --> 02:04:23.603
be checked.

02:04:23.772 --> 02:04:25.772
We heard from a number of

02:04:25.941 --> 02:04:28.176
small business owner who
expressed concerns from

02:04:28.478 --> 02:04:30.412
decreased foot traffic and
revenue to employees not able

02:04:31.647 --> 02:04:33.782
to get in and out of the
security perimeter.

02:04:37.186 --> 02:04:39.186
From residents we heard many

02:04:43.625 --> 02:04:44.959
concerns about access to care
givers.

02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:48.129
I want to express approximation

02:04:50.333 --> 02:04:52.868
to organizations like soma
pilipinas and yerba buena

02:04:53.402 --> 02:04:56.104
community benefit district
tremendous partners in outreach.

02:04:58.107 --> 02:05:00.107
I think it bears mentioning

02:05:00.609 --> 02:05:02.978
that I want to express
gratitude to state and federal

02:05:04.781 --> 02:05:06.148
partners for making apec
success.

02:05:07.217 --> 02:05:09.718
This is something I think we
don't have lot of these.

02:05:10.887 --> 02:05:13.880
Every 75 years we have a
national special security
events.

02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:15.923
There was a lot of-I had a lot

02:05:16.459 --> 02:05:18.860
of worry about it, but I think
it went pretty well so thank

02:05:19.896 --> 02:05:21.896
supervisor chan for her work on

02:05:21.932 --> 02:05:23.932
the earlier resolution.

02:05:26.303 --> 02:05:28.704
Thank soma pilipinas director
[Indiscernible] From yerba

02:05:29.105 --> 02:05:31.105
buena cbd for the work on the

02:05:31.674 --> 02:05:33.976
front lines of these businesses
and residents deserve to be
heard.

02:05:34.510 --> 02:05:36.510
I think that will give a chance

02:05:36.579 --> 02:05:39.415
at the hearing to hear from
them and we are giving them a

02:05:40.283 --> 02:05:42.885
forum to share stories, so city
agencies can be best informed

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:46.589
how to support them and hoping
it will inform agencies and

02:05:47.123 --> 02:05:49.525
city partners what we might be
able to do mitigate hardships

02:05:49.525 --> 02:05:52.394
if any.
The rest I submit.

02:05:54.698 --> 02:05:56.698

MR. Chair.
Supervisor melgar.

02:06:04.741 --> 02:06:06.741
>> thank you MADAM Clerk.

02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:09.378
Colleagues, today I am
introducing legislation to

02:06:09.746 --> 02:06:12.281
allow tenants living in
substandard housing to have a

02:06:12.783 --> 02:06:14.918
right of action against
landlords who refuse to cure

02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:18.530
life and safety issues.

02:06:18.789 --> 02:06:20.789
It will enhance damages when a

02:06:20.924 --> 02:06:23.920
child or senior are harmed by
their living conditions.

02:06:25.996 --> 02:06:27.996
It will run parallel and does

02:06:28.565 --> 02:06:31.468
not supersede action by dbi or
the city attorney.

02:06:33.304 --> 02:06:35.305
i know that we all heard
stories about families.

02:06:37.207 --> 02:06:38.742
We heard them today from martha
ryan.

02:06:40.111 --> 02:06:42.946
Living in unsafe and
unsustainable conditions

02:06:43.781 --> 02:06:45.848
because the landlords wont
maintain essential conditions

02:06:47.452 --> 02:06:49.452
in their properties.

02:06:50.355 --> 02:06:53.230
Peer reviewed research and
common sense demonstrate living

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:58.628
in pour housing conditions
cause lifelong health and

02:06:58.829 --> 02:07:01.398
mental consequence especially
devastating to children.

02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:06.770
Children living in homes with
laecking roof, lack of heat,

02:07:07.205 --> 02:07:09.205
unsafe environment show

02:07:09.307 --> 02:07:11.307
emotional behavioral problems.

02:07:13.178 --> 02:07:15.213
School absence and stress can
have lifelong learning

02:07:15.213 --> 02:07:17.180
consequence and loss of
learning potential for the

02:07:18.616 --> 02:07:20.616
parent and the child.

02:07:20.918 --> 02:07:22.918
A german study found increase

02:07:23.550 --> 02:07:25.550
of 20 percent in doctor visits

02:07:26.358 --> 02:07:29.126
for age groups over 64 living
in poor conditions and increase

02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:32.663
in early deathss for seniors.
Because low income families

02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:36.650
often lack the ability to move

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:39.680
and we have a very expensive

02:07:39.905 --> 02:07:41.905
city, they quitely suffer,

02:07:42.107 --> 02:07:44.109
stuck in terrible conditions
because they feel they have no

02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:46.477
ability to change the
circumstances.
We have the opportunity to

02:07:47.145 --> 02:07:49.145
change this and empower tenants

02:07:49.548 --> 02:07:51.248
to fight for their rights of
livable housing.

02:07:51.983 --> 02:07:53.983
Today more then 20 states allow

02:07:54.886 --> 02:07:56.520
tenants to sue their landlords
directly.

02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:59.757
Currently in california san
jose is leading the charge on

02:07:59.792 --> 02:08:01.792
tenants right of action and I

02:08:01.994 --> 02:08:04.796
hope san francisco will follow
suit.
Colleagues, I look forward to

02:08:05.631 --> 02:08:07.799
your support to create enhanced
protection for families and the

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
rest I submit.

02:09:16.369 --> 02:09:18.837
pride and resiliency.
Grandfather remembers a story

02:09:20.439 --> 02:09:22.439
how many field worker children

02:09:26.279 --> 02:09:28.279
went to school bare foot.

02:09:29.115 --> 02:09:31.115
They unleash the children on

02:09:31.718 --> 02:09:33.718
the piles and run to scrounge

02:09:34.287 --> 02:09:36.287
for the best looking shoes even

02:09:36.423 --> 02:09:39.258
two sizes too big.
He would rather have shoes that

02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:43.629

02:13:09.905 --> 02:13:11.905
From 2006 to 2019 on average

02:13:12.876 --> 02:13:14.876
over 800 people a year utilized

02:13:15.445 --> 02:13:18.247
the program when it was run by
the human services agency.

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.840
In 2019 the mayor's office

02:13:23.353 --> 02:13:25.587
buried this program deep in the
bureaucracy and obscureed who

02:13:26.489 --> 02:13:28.690
is responsible for it and for
running it.

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:32.528
Because the administration
mismanagement of the program

02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:36.432
fewer and fewer homeless people
and individuals access this

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.769
service and remain stuck on our
streets.
Since then only a fraction of

02:13:42.305 --> 02:13:45.107
that number use the program to
reconnect with family.

02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:48.420
Yes, this is also has been

02:13:49.947 --> 02:13:52.715
influenced by the pandemic, and
the impact of fentanyl crisis

02:13:53.116 --> 02:13:55.685
on our homeless population, but
that is absolutely not the

02:13:55.685 --> 02:13:57.685
whole story.

02:13:58.822 --> 02:14:01.190
It wasn't until the examiner
and chronicle wrote stories

02:14:01.825 --> 02:14:03.825
about the under utilization of

02:14:04.128 --> 02:14:07.960
the program that this
administration did something to

02:14:08.332 --> 02:14:10.332
change homeward bound.

02:14:10.534 --> 02:14:12.368
What they did, which is
restores hsa role in the

02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:15.872
program did not go far enough
and really back to the future

02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:21.444
what was successful in the
program since originally run

02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:25.248
the program and did it
successfully.
The legislation is about

02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:29.153
providing exit from the street
and also exit from the

02:14:29.153 --> 02:14:31.988
permanent supportive housing
system.
Something the city does not

02:14:32.456 --> 02:14:34.456
focus on enough.

02:14:36.493 --> 02:14:38.594
I want to charge homeward bound
to stand alone program, make

02:14:39.631 --> 02:14:41.631
clear quhoo is in charge and

02:14:41.732 --> 02:14:43.901
expand access to more people,
including those residents in

02:14:43.901 --> 02:14:45.901
the permanent supportive

02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:48.370
housing so they can reunit with

02:14:48.406 --> 02:14:50.406
their family and loved ones.

02:14:52.142 --> 02:14:54.877
We can continue to work on it
not just being what as it has

02:14:57.816 --> 02:14:59.816
in the past, a one way ticket

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.388
back to loved ones that of
course individuals would be

02:15:05.757 --> 02:15:07.757
checked on on day 30, day 60,

02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.461
day 90 to insure that they are
still supported, but this

02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:15.332
program has expanded to be
about transportation and other

02:15:15.467 --> 02:15:17.702
services they might need to
relocate back to the

02:15:17.702 --> 02:15:20.271
communities from which they
came.
with that colleagues, the rest

02:15:20.271 --> 02:15:22.271
I submit.

02:15:24.208 --> 02:15:27.110
>> thank you supervisor safai.
Supervisor stefani, submit.

02:15:27.145 --> 02:15:29.613

Thank you.

02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:35.353
MR. PRESIDENT, supervisor
walton.
Submit.
Thank you.

02:15:35.353 --> 02:15:37.355
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> go to general public

02:15:37.355 --> 02:15:38.956
comment.
>> alright.

02:15:39.891 --> 02:15:41.891
Those who are here in the

02:15:42.493 --> 02:15:44.928
chamber, please come to the
your right side, let's hear

02:15:48.199 --> 02:15:49.532
from our first speaker,
please.

02:15:56.642 --> 02:15:59.343
Welcome.
>> [Indiscernible] Invite you

02:15:59.978 --> 02:16:01.978
today to watch again what I

02:16:05.183 --> 02:16:07.352
said on FEBRUARY the 28th of
this year.

02:16:09.421 --> 02:16:11.556
I don't know what happened to
the baby.

02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:16.600
Still there going.
But, after you do that, please

02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:19.950
understand you are not focusing

02:16:19.564 --> 02:16:21.564
on what is important here.

02:16:22.167 --> 02:16:24.167
The picture is about fighting

02:16:24.337 --> 02:16:26.337
technology here.

02:16:26.739 --> 02:16:28.739
Technology especially in

02:16:28.874 --> 02:16:30.742
communication is public enemy
number one.

02:16:32.511 --> 02:16:35.480
We need to address this.
Be aware of what he is trying

02:16:37.516 --> 02:16:38.850
to do to society and around the
world.

02:16:41.554 --> 02:16:43.554
San francisco you guys have to

02:16:46.225 --> 02:16:48.225
be aware of that.

02:16:48.461 --> 02:16:50.461
We already said, stated 9

02:16:52.231 --> 02:16:54.231
months ago that it is game over

02:16:55.568 --> 02:16:57.935
for these people who have been
weaponizing technology.

02:16:59.390 --> 02:17:01.390
Technology cannot create beauty.

02:17:02.375 --> 02:17:04.375
That's not possible.

02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:07.746
we need beauty north in order
to be happy, otherwise it is

02:17:09.382 --> 02:17:11.382
not possible.

02:17:12.485 --> 02:17:14.485
It is extreme unintelligence

02:17:16.356 --> 02:17:19.125
for big tech to keep working on
artificial intelligence.

02:17:19.159 --> 02:17:21.360
This is [Indiscernible] From
big tech itself.

02:17:22.362 --> 02:17:24.362
You don't need artificial

02:17:24.697 --> 02:17:26.632
intelligence if you are
intelligent enough.

02:17:26.833 --> 02:17:28.833
End of story.

02:17:28.968 --> 02:17:30.968
Anyway, have a good day.

02:17:31.537 --> 02:17:34.390
Please I invite you to watch
the 28 of FEBRUARY what I said

02:17:35.409 --> 02:17:37.677
at the time when I said change
the course of whatever, san

02:17:37.711 --> 02:17:39.345
francisco at least.
Thank you.

02:17:45.451 --> 02:17:47.686
>> thank you for your comments.
Welcome.
>> thank you.

02:17:47.687 --> 02:17:49.821
I want to talk about something
I have been talking about the

02:17:50.857 --> 02:17:52.191
last couple weeks, couple
months.

02:17:53.861 --> 02:17:56.562
Light night I attended the
christmas tree right in castro.

02:17:57.331 --> 02:18:00.320
It was nice to see the city of
san francisco come together
last night.

02:18:01.668 --> 02:18:04.570
I come in college at north
eastern we studied the twinkie

02:18:05.205 --> 02:18:07.205
defense and most know it was

02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:10.430
not about twinkies sort of.
The corporation itt owned

02:18:12.146 --> 02:18:14.413
wonder bred and twinkies and
international telephone and

02:18:14.648 --> 02:18:16.849
telegraph company which started
in 1920.

02:18:21.655 --> 02:18:23.655
1977 it was worth $17 billion1

02:18:23.657 --> 02:18:25.657
(700) 000-0000 which made

02:18:26.294 --> 02:18:28.562
wonder bred and twink ease.
Voice and phone technology a

02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:32.132
person or group place in
digital surveillance and that

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:35.100
influenced dan white.

02:18:35.369 --> 02:18:38.370
In 1978, there were major
issues overseas and within the

02:18:38.472 --> 02:18:40.472
united states after vietnam.

02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:43.242
we were in a culture war and
war among ourselves.

02:18:44.612 --> 02:18:47.447
When that happens on digital
surveillance it leads to

02:18:48.483 --> 02:18:50.483
increase intake of alcohol,

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:55.880
increase of shugry food,
anxiety, drugs and upset and

02:18:56.423 --> 02:18:58.423
angry you are easily influenced

02:18:59.693 --> 02:19:01.930
under phone and voice
technology.

02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:04.898
Just like today there are
issues abroad and domestically

02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:08.100
and wars rage and not just in

02:19:08.202 --> 02:19:10.202
san francisco people are placed

02:19:10.705 --> 02:19:12.705
on surveillance with people who

02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:16.843
don't have best interest in
mind.
We need peace, unity and

02:19:18.412 --> 02:19:20.412
community and ask the board of

02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:23.183
supervisors to convene a
meeting to discuss danger of

02:19:24.352 --> 02:19:26.352
voice and phone technology and

02:19:26.654 --> 02:19:28.654
immediately take off every

02:19:30.358 --> 02:19:32.626
citizen on digital surveill nls
in san francisco.

02:19:33.561 --> 02:19:36.463
Meta data isn't new.
East germany used it.

02:19:36.965 --> 02:19:39.533
It isn't new, it has been
around decades and I make

02:19:40.235 --> 02:19:43.137
myself available to each of you
for consulting on this matter.
Thank you.

02:19:43.938 --> 02:19:46.106
>> thank you christopher cline
for your comments.

02:19:48.610 --> 02:19:51.245
Next speaker, please.
Welcome.
>> hello.

02:19:54.450 --> 02:19:56.450
My name is brenda baros.

02:19:57.186 --> 02:19:58.519
We both work at san francisco
general.

02:19:59.421 --> 02:20:02.256
We heard you talking about the
budget and so that brought some

02:20:03.325 --> 02:20:05.325
things to mind for us like we

02:20:05.894 --> 02:20:08.128
heard about the deal for the
land out at san francisco

02:20:10.432 --> 02:20:11.799
general where they got for
nothing.

02:20:13.269 --> 02:20:15.269
We hear about all these other

02:20:16.305 --> 02:20:18.305
things that is just giving away

02:20:18.474 --> 02:20:20.474
money to people.

02:20:20.943 --> 02:20:22.643
not charging developer s and
things like that.

02:20:23.946 --> 02:20:25.946
When you come to us and you

02:20:26.548 --> 02:20:28.548
start asking us to give up or

02:20:30.219 --> 02:20:32.453
you start asking us that we
should take a little less,

02:20:33.289 --> 02:20:35.156
remember we are looking at all
of that stuff.

02:20:38.928 --> 02:20:40.928
We are looking at every public

02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:43.531
service contract that is
basically giving our work to

02:20:43.966 --> 02:20:45.966
somebody else to do rather then

02:20:46.703 --> 02:20:48.703
paying us to do it.

02:20:50.506 --> 02:20:52.506
$39 million for overtime,

02:20:53.342 --> 02:20:54.876
honesty, dph workers are burned
out.

02:20:56.812 --> 02:20:58.812
There are a lot of employees

02:20:59.849 --> 02:21:02.160
that refuse to do overtime
anymore.
That isn't the solution.

02:21:02.785 --> 02:21:05.621
They need to hire people so we
can have people to do what they

02:21:07.724 --> 02:21:09.724
need to do, not just pay some

02:21:10.930 --> 02:21:12.930
people overtime and everybody

02:21:12.495 --> 02:21:15.310
else continue to struggle and
suffer and the clients are the

02:21:15.310 --> 02:21:17.310
ones that really suffer.

02:21:17.133 --> 02:21:19.768
I work in clinics.
Sometimes you have to wait

02:21:21.972 --> 02:21:24.773
month tuesday months to get an
appointment.
That is outrageous.

02:21:24.841 --> 02:21:27.343
It should not be that way and
that is because we dont have

02:21:30.246 --> 02:21:32.246
enough doctors and don't have

02:21:33.983 --> 02:21:35.983
enough staff.

02:21:36.850 --> 02:21:38.850
>> thank you for your comments.

02:21:38.855 --> 02:21:40.855
>> the world bank has been

02:21:42.859 --> 02:21:45.394
producing the pcr test at 2018.
Think about that, this is

02:21:45.629 --> 02:21:48.364
everything we have been told is
a lie, a absolute lie.

02:21:48.965 --> 02:21:51.433
There is very people on the
radio that are admitting what

02:21:51.468 --> 02:21:53.468
this is all about.

02:21:54.437 --> 02:21:56.437
There is a guy on k fax monday

02:21:57.441 --> 02:22:00.309
at 5 P.M. For 2 hours and
exposing the covid lie.

02:22:02.446 --> 02:22:05.248
There are so many lies out
there.
one lie we have been taught is

02:22:05.949 --> 02:22:07.650
the earth is round and it is
spinning.

02:22:08.585 --> 02:22:10.585
It is actually flat.

02:22:10.921 --> 02:22:12.921
Antarctica is not a continent t

02:22:13.357 --> 02:22:15.992
is the ice wall around the rim
of the flat earth.

02:22:16.227 --> 02:22:18.227
There is no south pole.

02:22:18.262 --> 02:22:20.496
It is like a pizza and the
crust is antarctica.

02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:24.433
GOD is very very close and we

02:22:25.135 --> 02:22:27.135
never went to the moon.

02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:29.305
Nasa is bunch of liars.
No respect for nasa.

02:22:29.773 --> 02:22:31.773
The reason I try to convince

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:34.811
the irth is flat is maybe that
will make you read the bible

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:38.581
and believe in jesus christ
because GOD is so close.

02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:42.118
In the north pole they have
this big black stone that goes

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:45.354
higher then the cloud and has a

02:22:45.756 --> 02:22:48.691
magnetic force.
All the compasses point north,

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.160
but it is round.

02:22:51.396 --> 02:22:53.964
It is actually round.
We never went to the moon.

02:22:54.532 --> 02:22:56.933
The whole thing is lie landing
on the moon.

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:59.635
If you ask your pilot the next

02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:02.472
time you fly or read the pilot
manual it says it is flat.

02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:04.940
It isn't moving.

02:23:05.476 --> 02:23:07.945
I was cleaning the carpet of a
guy not long ago and told him

02:23:08.847 --> 02:23:10.847
that and said I know, I have

02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:13.650
been flying 50 years.
We are spinning on a ball.

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:16.653
You think might need to take a
little consideration.

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:19.588
500 miles a hour if we are

02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:22.910
spinning at a thousand 66 miles

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.760
a urho, hour, we are not.

02:23:24.763 --> 02:23:27.297
We are not.
Jesus is coming back.

02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:30.660
We dont know the day and hour.

02:23:30.402 --> 02:23:32.402
We know if we care to know we

02:23:32.504 --> 02:23:34.504
are in a sabbath year right now.

02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:37.373
We are in a sabbath year and

02:23:37.408 --> 02:23:39.976
the only process in the bible
is daniel 9 that narrows down

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:41.913
the year that christ would die
on the cross.

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:44.582
It is all related to sabbath
years.

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.185
It is still not too late to get
saved.

02:23:50.622 --> 02:23:52.622
Repent, call upon jesus

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.525
sincerely and we hill save your
soul.

02:23:59.198 --> 02:24:01.198
>> next speaker, please.

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:06.369
>> something to pass out.

02:24:18.651 --> 02:24:20.651
Jtsds

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.955
>> hello, my name is
[Indiscernible] I e-mailed most

02:24:26.458 --> 02:24:29.393
of you what this is with a lot
more information.

02:24:29.861 --> 02:24:31.861
So, I personally believe that

02:24:33.499 --> 02:24:35.499
there is a city hall and county

02:24:37.103 --> 02:24:39.905
employee who has been very
transphobic among other things

02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.800
on social media targeting
transactivist as well.

02:24:46.412 --> 02:24:48.790
I'll read I read what I have
here.

02:24:49.848 --> 02:24:51.848
If the man is city county

02:24:53.753 --> 02:24:55.820
employee the fact he targeted
transactivist for simply giving

02:24:56.355 --> 02:24:59.224
public comment and sharing our
opinions with government

02:24:59.258 --> 02:25:01.258
representatives that would be

02:25:01.294 --> 02:25:03.294
unacceptable to me or any

02:25:04.163 --> 02:25:06.398
activist to be retaliated
against by the city government

02:25:06.398 --> 02:25:08.398
for exercisers first amendment.

02:25:09.736 --> 02:25:11.737
I went to human right
commission but the commission

02:25:12.138 --> 02:25:14.139
lost my complaint and told me
they can't do anything.

02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:18.900
They suggest I call 311 for

02:25:18.277 --> 02:25:19.811
help or try the whistle blowing
phone number.

02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:23.380
What would you do?

02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:27.987
I included examples of the
transphobic things this person
has shared.

02:25:28.388 --> 02:25:30.256
For the record I don't get paid
to be here.

02:25:31.358 --> 02:25:33.358
It cost me money every time I

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:34.727
print out these fliers at the
library.

02:25:35.562 --> 02:25:37.562
It is also disheartening when

02:25:38.564 --> 02:25:41.333
people I thought more
transgender accepting then

02:25:42.350 --> 02:25:44.303
colleagues certain colleagues
on the board when they don't

02:25:47.407 --> 02:25:49.909
say anything on the transgender
day of remembrance how much

02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:53.312
more press do you want
transkids and adults to be.

02:25:53.847 --> 02:25:56.115
You want to pass a resolution
on 8 grade algebra.

02:25:57.884 --> 02:25:59.884
How about resolution on getting

02:26:00.186 --> 02:26:02.822
transkids restrooms so they can
urinate and defecate and do

02:26:03.123 --> 02:26:05.123
other regular restroom humanly

02:26:07.494 --> 02:26:09.929
things at school?
It is dehumanizing to not have

02:26:12.399 --> 02:26:15.267
restrooms at school for these
kids.
Do you care?

02:26:16.703 --> 02:26:18.703
>> thank you for your comments.

02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:26.779
Next speaker, please.
>> good afternoon.

02:26:29.783 --> 02:26:31.783
Subject is rent control.

02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.850
Two phrases I like you to keep

02:26:34.688 --> 02:26:36.688
in your mind when voting on

02:26:39.894 --> 02:26:41.894
these issues, demolition is

02:26:42.763 --> 02:26:45.310
death, and eviction is death.
Thank you.

02:26:45.766 --> 02:26:47.766
>> thank you for your comments.

02:26:51.538 --> 02:26:54.374
Next speaker, please.
>> good afternoon supervisors.

02:26:57.612 --> 02:26:59.446
My name is jake connor ortega
[Indiscernible] Something funny

02:27:00.181 --> 02:27:02.181
I heard earlier from supervisor

02:27:02.683 --> 02:27:04.419
preston was that the police are
flooded downtown but none are

02:27:05.686 --> 02:27:07.686
in the tenderloin.

02:27:07.888 --> 02:27:10.123
As the supervoozer of the
tenderloin he requested less

02:27:11.893 --> 02:27:13.893
police and more ambassadors, so

02:27:13.895 --> 02:27:16.230
deaths in the tenderloin
wouldn't have happened if the

02:27:16.431 --> 02:27:18.431
tenderloin was cleaned up, but

02:27:19.267 --> 02:27:22.202
I say I agree with preston
voting it down, safai poison

02:27:24.972 --> 02:27:26.972
amendment such a disappointment.

02:27:27.675 --> 02:27:30.578
However, before apec I went to
break bred in district 6 and

02:27:31.947 --> 02:27:34.581
what blows me away was watching
his treat the homeless he

02:27:36.117 --> 02:27:38.285
engages with as if they were
his family.

02:27:39.554 --> 02:27:41.554
What angers me is that adam is

02:27:43.324 --> 02:27:45.759
truly one of the best san
franciscans I have the honor

02:27:46.195 --> 02:27:48.195
knowing and like many residents

02:27:48.197 --> 02:27:50.932
and business owners, he and
many others are having to do

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:54.340
the job this board should be

02:27:54.936 --> 02:27:56.936
doing, which is keeping the

02:27:56.938 --> 02:27:58.938
city safe, insuring businesses

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:01.540
stay here in the city, but

02:28:01.742 --> 02:28:03.742
businesses around the city are

02:28:03.745 --> 02:28:05.745
constantly suffering from

02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:10.318
theft, broken windows,
vandalized and being beaten

02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:12.653
down by lack of response they
close forever.

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.423
We pay so much in taxes, both
residents and tourists alike

02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:20.261
only to have that money be
constantly wasted on fruitless

02:28:20.261 --> 02:28:22.261
projects.

02:28:23.399 --> 02:28:26.670
And as a insult any elected
official asks us for support

02:28:27.937 --> 02:28:30.671
when those same elected push
forward legislation as killing
our city.

02:28:31.974 --> 02:28:34.176
No longer are we afraid to hold
those running for office

02:28:34.176 --> 02:28:37.440
accountable.
Now, it is already too late for

02:28:38.781 --> 02:28:40.749
the board to get sizable
recovery achieved, so for those

02:28:42.551 --> 02:28:45.420
who are running for office in
2024 like you supervisor

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.880
stefani, we will be holding

02:28:49.458 --> 02:28:52.930
anyone who voted in favor of
the [Indiscernible] Thank you.

02:28:54.563 --> 02:28:57.232
>> before the next speaker,
I'll just-jay connor, here at

02:28:57.967 --> 02:29:00.769
the board when you are in a
board meeting and an item is on

02:29:01.504 --> 02:29:03.504
the agenda you cannot speak to

02:29:05.641 --> 02:29:07.641
it as you did regarding the

02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:10.278
charter amendment.
It is committee you go and

02:29:11.614 --> 02:29:13.681
provide those comments.
okay.
Welcome.

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:20.880
>> are thank you so
much:fighter abolitionist and

02:29:21.891 --> 02:29:24.726
social justice fighter for me
people and nation to make a

02:29:25.528 --> 02:29:27.596
better humanity.
I enjoyed myself today.

02:29:28.631 --> 02:29:29.931
A lot of people say why do you
come?

02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:33.340
What are you receiving from

02:29:33.303 --> 02:29:34.670
coming and sitting in these
chambers?

02:29:35.739 --> 02:29:38.507
Myself say to them is that, we
can complain all day about what

02:29:39.542 --> 02:29:42.244
is not being done for our
people, however, if you don't

02:29:43.413 --> 02:29:46.148
show up how can you complain?
So, I continue to come and
stand.

02:29:47.918 --> 02:29:49.918
I was very very inspired to

02:29:50.354 --> 02:29:52.989
hear the story of martha and
also joe, if I'm pronouncing

02:29:53.457 --> 02:29:56.292
the name correctly.
It is inspiration to myself

02:29:58.228 --> 02:30:00.729
because so many issues we can
address.
Myself being cultural

02:30:01.864 --> 02:30:03.399
representing the whole of the
person.

02:30:04.134 --> 02:30:05.601
So many issues I see that you
are tackling.

02:30:06.737 --> 02:30:08.737
I want to speak on one

02:30:09.606 --> 02:30:11.641
particular one and that is
mothers and families of

02:30:11.809 --> 02:30:13.809
murdered children.

02:30:14.144 --> 02:30:16.144
We presented to you about two

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:19.448
weeks ago a document of two
homes in regards that I have

02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:22.751
been stating I want to invite
you and we will be coming today

02:30:24.322 --> 02:30:26.322
and getting your schedule and

02:30:26.824 --> 02:30:28.824
information to see these homes.

02:30:28.959 --> 02:30:31.261
It has been brought to the
attention of some here

02:30:31.261 --> 02:30:33.296
representing supervisors,
brought to their attention, but

02:30:34.798 --> 02:30:36.798
one of my particular partners

02:30:37.367 --> 02:30:40.269
he pays $14 thousand a month
for the mortgage in bayview and

02:30:41.406 --> 02:30:44.275
there is no place in bayview
for the mothers and families to

02:30:44.275 --> 02:30:46.275
go of murdered children.

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.780
We want you to be able to come

02:30:49.447 --> 02:30:51.447
to hear martha and joe their

02:30:53.535 --> 02:30:55.718
homes and their businesses were
also a purchase through by way
of those who care.

02:30:56.286 --> 02:30:58.889
We would like you to come and
look at the two homes we have.

02:30:59.390 --> 02:31:01.390
It is the only homes we would

02:31:02.894 --> 02:31:05.629
be able to have for mothers and
families of murdered children.
Thank you kindly.
