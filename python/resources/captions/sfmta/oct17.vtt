director uchitel. I'd like to
open with one new and unfinished

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.257
item, which is I had asked
previously our new directors

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.693
director so and director
henderson to share a few

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:53.694
reflections on their priorities

00:02:54.397 --> 00:02:56.397
coming into the meeting, into

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.368
the board and I know you had a
chance to share priorities with

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.738
the staff at a town hall, and I
wondered if we could just turn

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.740
the mic to you all to share a
couple reflections on your

00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:09.546
priorities for your service.

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.215
Thank you. Chair. Good
afternoon, everyone. Good

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.318
afternoon. Welcome back. Many

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.859
and I my priorities are pretty
consistent. I think everyone had

00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.761
already hear it many, many

00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:29.332
times. And but I am really
appreciative of putting it on

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:32.801
this form. Um, because it's

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.971
become an agenda item and then
we are going to set some of

00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.541
these items interactions in our

00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:41.976
next year. So my first foremost

00:03:44.147 --> 00:03:46.883
priority is public safety, but
that's a really broad item. So I

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:52.255
wanted to distill down to a few
things that I think it could be

00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:59.427
in immediately actionable. So,

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.429
so it's a safe ridership on

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:03.431
public transportation is what I

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.501
really want to focus. And

00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:08.705
precisely it touches along
vision zero. That is something

00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:11.907
that we all really wanted to get

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:15.677
better at and we are working to

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:17.946
get better at this and I wanted

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:21.716
to see that we have this thing.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.819
Imagine every parents feel

00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:27.123
confident and safe to let their

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.293
own children to ride muni to
schools and after school

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:34.496
programs just as simple as that.

00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:36.498
I understand that this is not

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:39.370
something that in our own agency
we can single handedly to

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.400
achieve that because there is so
much it takes to how to get

00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:45.641
these kids to be on the street

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.411
and get to the stop and safely

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:50.813
wait for our muni and then get

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:54.549
on and get off. So I would like

00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:57.187
to continue to work and foster

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.990
more, relate with our police
department and some other

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:05.295
community. His group to help us

00:05:07.198 --> 00:05:10.000
to achieve this priorities that
I want to have because that's a

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.601
very important thing. Everyone

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.771
has kids and everyone's friends

00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:17.642
has kids. Not everyone, but we
all understand. We all are kids

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.245
once. So that is my priority
number one. And my second

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:26.750
priority is reaching out to more
culturally appropriate community

00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:29.852
outreach, focusing on people

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.220
look like me and people look

00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:36.226
like like they are a minority in

00:05:38.497 --> 00:05:40.497
this city. So racial equity and

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:43.734
belonging is something that I
hold really dear to and I carry

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.605
it on from my previous
experience in the arts

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:50.207
commission and then in the

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.445
planning department in this
commission called historic

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:57.182
preservation commission. And so
I would love to continue you to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.850
see we I think our agency had a

00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:05.289
really robust program. So I
would love to continue to

00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:08.592
elevate us to continue to adapt

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.665
and be very, very culturally,
appropriately reaching out to

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.600
our different communities and

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:18.603
especially in our community

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.639
stations. So the third one is my

00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:25.876
priority is focusing on how can

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:28.312
we find more money, more funding

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:34.118
and I because this is this is

00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:37.155
really important, you know, at
the end of the day, we need that

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.270
gas. We need that juice to run.

00:06:43.864 --> 00:06:45.965
And precisely I see this as not
just a local issue, as a

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.680
regional issue. So we have to
really think really outside of

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:51.803
the box. And I would love to

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:54.973
have a lot of creative thinking
of people here and also whoever

00:06:56.475 --> 00:06:58.645
else is listening to. I'm like
really tapping into my friend us

00:07:00.647 --> 00:07:02.647
who have done amazing things

00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:05.510
themselves and just to see what
can we do locally and also

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.722
regional in the state level and
federal level, because I think

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.825
that this will really help us

00:07:13.993 --> 00:07:15.929
and to solve one piece of the
puzzle or to better position our

00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:19.832
agency to be competitively to

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.236
hire staff with a purposeful
skill sets that are ready to

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:25.904
face our current and future

00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:28.807
challenges. That's it. That's

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.420
all I have to say. Thank you so

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.480
much, director. So it's really
helpful to hear your priorities.

00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:36.348
Director henderson good

00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:38.584
afternoon, everyone, and thank

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:40.986
you, chair, for allowing me the

00:07:41.655 --> 00:07:43.690
opportunity to share with you
all a little bit about the

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.793
priorities that I see. I pretty
much am in alignment with with

00:07:48.862 --> 00:07:50.862
what director soul offered. I

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.700
think that safety is really
important. Safety on our

00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:56.168
systems, but also safe

00:07:57.405 --> 00:07:59.405
neighborhoods. I am a hauser by

00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.441
profession and so part of my

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:05.145
every day job is to make sure
that I'm creating communities

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.580
that people want to live in,

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:11.417
feel safe in. And part of that,

00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:14.621
I think, is our ability through

00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:17.624
this agency to really connect
neighborhoods, make certain

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.828
parts of san francisco so that
oftentimes are under the radar

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:25.732
or or a little bit on the edges
of the map. Make them

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:29.537
accessible. You know, the hills
don't make the city super easy

00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:33.506
to traverse. So I think that we

00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:36.475
really do have an opportunity to

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:39.847
ensure that folks, whether they
live in the center of the city

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:42.815
or on the periphery, are able to

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:48.955
access shops, health care, to

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.626
have stable housing and stable
neighborhoods and really are

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.329
able to enjoy their neighborhood
and parts of the city that they

00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:59.233
MAY not necessarily be visit
often, but it doesn't take

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.970
forever to get there. And I hope

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:06.106
that I hope that we are able to

00:09:07.977 --> 00:09:10.845
focus while I'm here on on
really creating neighbor hoods

00:09:11.913 --> 00:09:13.913
that families, that individuals

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.784
that people can enjoy and feel
safe in, safe walking down the

00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:19.655
streets, wide sidewalks. I think
it's so, so important to create

00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:24.860
a sense of place and so I look
forward to learning more, but

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.620
also contributing to creating

00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:30.664
that throughout the city and

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:34.402
especially in areas where where
they historically have have not

00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.105
had those types of amenities. I

00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:40.676
also really prioritize equity
and want to make sure that those

00:09:40.676 --> 00:09:42.676
neighborhoods that I've

00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:45.551
mentioned across the city are

00:09:46.215 --> 00:09:48.717
adequate represented, have that
seat at the table, have the

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.690
voice at and are open for
business. Just like just like

00:09:54.858 --> 00:09:56.858
other areas. I really want to

00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.362
make sure that the mta can
continue to make the city excel

00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:04.732
and surpass all of the

00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:08.700
expectations that we have to be
the great place to live that

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:11.305
I've grown up in and that that I

00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:15.677
hope to, you know, be in forever

00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:18.146
really. And then finally and I

00:10:18.382 --> 00:10:20.382
think that, you know, it's funny

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:23.184
that find the money but also

00:10:24.688 --> 00:10:26.688
ensuring that we are caretakers

00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:33.695
of this resource that we ensure

00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:36.365
that the fiscal and financial

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:39.736
viability of this agency is top
tier and top notch, that we're

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.390
able to have a successful the

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.910
next 100, 150 years of our

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:51.348
transit systems building and
building neighborhoods and

00:10:53.584 --> 00:10:55.752
commuter city. I think it's one
thing to create place, but

00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:58.855
really to create that sense of
community. And I think ensuring

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.825
that the financial stability of
this agency long term will make

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.529
sure that we can create that

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:09.632
community, that that that is so

00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:12.669
important. And so I look forward
to all the work that we'll do

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.342
here together. And I'd that's it
. Thank you so much. Yes. Really

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:22.313
really grateful to both of you
for sharing some some thoughts

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.215
and just as a reminder for
everyone, this was a question I

00:11:25.483 --> 00:11:27.483
asked all the members of the

00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:29.786
board at our FEBRUARY workshop
at the beginning of this year,

00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:33.890
and we're closer now to the
JANUARY workshop next year than

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:35.960
we are to that one. So we'll
have another opportunity to

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.562
revisit priorities. But it's
helpful for me as chair to know

00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.632
your priorities and I also think
for staff and ensuring that we

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.468
make sufficient air time at
these meetings and staff

00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:46.770
resources are allocated to those
priorities. So really appreciate

00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:52.408
that other members of the board,

00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:56.478
director yakusho. Thank you so

00:11:57.682 --> 00:11:59.682
much. Chair eken and I'm so

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.886
excited to see both of my new

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.550
colleagues get all that shit

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.958
done. And I believe that you
can. I also see the fire

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.195
marshals in the room, so I just
want to acknowledge him. Thank

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.796
you for being here. Fire marshal

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.938
coughlin and. I. I have some new

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.742
business a lot of you MAY have
heard. Maybe you didn't hear

00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:29.180
that I spent the last week and a
half in israel, pretty much in

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.490
and out of bomb shelters and

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:35.320
decided to throw myself into the
volunteer effort that had been

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.690
going on there to collect
donated items and deliver it to

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.959
families who are suffering and

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:46.229
being there was deeply inspired

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.767
bring. I saw thousands of people
come together, old and young

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.171
people from all walks of life.
And I actually was able to see

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.642
in front of me what it looks
like when a whole community can

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:59.444
come together to get things
done, to put their differences

00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:02.313
aside and work as a unit. And it

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.682
reminded me of why I am in this
work. It reminded me of why I

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:07.919
consider myself an organizer and

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.121
an activist and why I came to

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.726
san francisco. It inspired me
and frankly, when I came back a

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:16.894
few days ago, it made me really

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.630
reconsider everything about

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.980
about what I'm doing and how I

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.100
spend my time and what motivates

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:25.972
me and what lights me on fire.
And so because of that, I

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:29.641
decided that this is going to be

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.545
my last meeting as an sfmta
director and that I'm going to

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:36.414
be leaving the board. I have so

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.352
much respect for this agency and
I know it's tough because we

00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:43.689
just got our full board. I have

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:47.493
respect for the agency. I have
respect for you all, and I have

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.196
even more respect for the
thousands and thousands of

00:13:51.732 --> 00:13:53.732
workers who allow us to do what

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.669
we do. So I'm really, really
proud of what we've been able to

00:13:57.438 --> 00:14:00.730
accomplish on this board.
Navigating our aging agency

00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:03.609
through a once in a century dark

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.677
time and a pandemic, and being

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:09.215
in the trenches with all of you
on fucking microsoft teams

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.584
building the jfk promenade and

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.820
building dozens of miles of

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.491
transit only lanes, creating a
new slow streets network,

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:20.594
pushing this agency to create a
connected network of bike lanes,

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:24.598
helping institute a first in the
nation. Text before tow program

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:28.468
re negotiating our contract with
clear channel to clean our bus

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.570
shelters and get them looking

00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:33.974
like we want them to look like
and helping. Working alongside

00:14:35.176 --> 00:14:37.845
jeff, tom and julie to get our
internal house in order. I'm so

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.948
proud of where this agency is
now and all that we've been able

00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:44.317
to accomplish together over the
last three years that I've been

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.652
on this board. I have absolute

00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:50.489
confidence in the sf mta I have

00:14:52.127 --> 00:14:54.328
confidence in all of you and I'm
so excited to cheer you guys on

00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:57.931
from the sidelines working with

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:00.333
directors ly and board and

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.700
brinkman eken kahena hemminger.

00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:07.942
So henderson and hinsey has been
one of the great honors of my

00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:11.411
life. This is a varsity team and

00:15:11.547 --> 00:15:14.348
I'm so proud of what we've been
able to do together. So thank

00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:17.218
you for making me feel so
welcome. Thank you for giving me

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:19.385
this opportunity and for

00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:21.421
believing in me. I've only just

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.390
gotten started. And that is my

00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:35.470
new business is. Who I know. Is
there a motion to approve or

00:15:39.174 --> 00:15:41.642
disapprove? I make a motion to
reject the premise of director

00:15:43.312 --> 00:15:46.181
leaving colleagues. I know this
is probably shocking news, so I

00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:49.618
want to make some space. Not
necessarily today, but at a

00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:54.489
future meeting. For some remarks
and reflections and gratitude
for director yekutiel. Once you

00:15:55.591 --> 00:15:57.659
can gather your thoughts,
obviously, if anyone would like

00:15:58.694 --> 00:16:01.263
to add anything now, please feel
free. But he has committed to me

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:04.699
to come to at least one more

00:16:05.702 --> 00:16:07.736
meeting to be recognized for his
service so we could do that. The

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:15.376
next meeting perhaps. Okay are

00:16:15.578 --> 00:16:17.578
there any other items of new or

00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:24.552
unfinished. Director? So. I'll

00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:27.221
take this moment to say a few

00:16:30.693 --> 00:16:33.662
words because this is my new
favorite neighbor for a few

00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:39.467
times in the past few months.

00:16:41.137 --> 00:16:43.137
And you or two. But is like to

00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:46.941
soon you are a legend. I always

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:52.147
I met many many years ago in a
lot of community benefiting

00:16:53.183 --> 00:16:55.183
event and he's always so

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.519
enthusiastic about everything

00:16:58.288 --> 00:17:00.288
that is for the community and I

00:17:01.324 --> 00:17:03.324
live in the mission so many cafe

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.595
is always the corner where I
will hang out with my

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.598
girlfriends, you know, and
seeing the place had looking

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:15.238
really spiffy. And jesse now for
me, it was before and I'm going

00:17:15.873 --> 00:17:18.841
to MISS You a lot. I will take
some moment to process what I

00:17:19.143 --> 00:17:22.111
also need to say more glorified
version of what I feel about

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:24.646
you. But I just feel a little

00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.383
missing you, you know, like
you're just going to be an empty

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:30.986
seat, you know? And but I think

00:17:31.422 --> 00:17:34.357
that the work that you do throw
yourself out there in this past

00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:37.761
ten days where everyone was
fleeting and trying to find a

00:17:39.663 --> 00:17:41.798
place to leave, you actually
jump into the fire to help

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.470
really, really, really. Really

00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:49.472
hit really hit me. You know,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800
it's like that selfless of

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.470
courage to go out and do your
part. And that's I had you have

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.985
my highest respect for you for
to do that I'm just really

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:04.687
grateful that you come home and

00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:08.257
safely and also use your ability

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.195
to continue to do what you feel
is the best use of your talent

00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:14.931
and your influence and

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
advocating for the cause that

00:18:18.136 --> 00:18:20.136
you care for your. Yes. And this

00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:22.707
is really heavy and it trumped
over what I actually wanted to

00:18:23.475 --> 00:18:25.676
also share. And that is
something that I thought that's

00:18:26.678 --> 00:18:29.547
also really important and it's a
different topic, but many I just

00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:32.283
really, really appreciate you
and we're going to continue to

00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:35.753
be working on a lot of other
issues in other capacities,

00:18:38.557 --> 00:18:41.359
right? So I'm going to share
another thing I wanted to share

00:18:42.695 --> 00:18:45.229
for last week. I attended well,
this month is the filipino

00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.231
american filipino heritage

00:18:49.768 --> 00:18:51.768
month. So last week I got some

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.700
time to actually I got invited

00:18:55.775 --> 00:18:58.710
to our cable car museum and
actually did that celebration

00:19:01.814 --> 00:19:03.814
with our filipino american asian

00:19:05.484 --> 00:19:07.484
friends and colleagues and staff

00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:11.621
and even our fellow I believe

00:19:11.858 --> 00:19:13.858
he's in entertainment commission

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:17.528
. Al perez was there. He also is

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.530
the vice chair of the a asian

00:19:19.732 --> 00:19:22.367
heritage aapi, asian pacific
islander heritage month

00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:28.390
organizer. So and our favorite
secretary, christine, was there,

00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:30.741
too. And it was a really great

00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:34.645
moment where our equity, racial

00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:38.449
equity and belonging group find

00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:40.785
their time and actually some of

00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:44.289
the manager went across town to
their favorite filipino stores

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.660
to buy the best lumpia to share

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.970
with everyone. And it was a very

00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:57.690
warm getting together moment in
also in a very unsettled time of

00:19:59.272 --> 00:20:01.272
our current world. And I think

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800
it's always good to take a

00:20:04.445 --> 00:20:07.413
moment and really reach out to
our neighbors and friends and

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.150
people that you you know or you

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:14.987
don't know and you just get get
together and celebrate each

00:20:16.523 --> 00:20:19.492
other's press alliance. And this
is very important. I actually

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:23.129
was saying that we every year
we're going to go bigger. Right,

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.666
christine? Every year we're
going to go bigger and do more

00:20:29.636 --> 00:20:31.804
celebration because I am aware
of that. We have a lot of

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.275
filipino american in our agency,
see, and I love all of them.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:40.180
They all have their talent and
they spend overnight to decked

00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:43.250
out the cable car with the
history of all the significant

00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:45.885
filipino americans that had

00:20:46.821 --> 00:20:48.888
contributed not only to san
francisco, but the history of

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.990
transportation in our city. So

00:20:51.992 --> 00:20:53.992
that was very important. And I

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.662
want to share it to everyone.
And please ride the cable car

00:21:00.935 --> 00:21:03.837
with me next year. Okay. If
there's nothing further from my

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.309
colleagues, I will open this
item for public comment for

00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:11.443
anyone attending the meeting in

00:21:19.354 --> 00:21:22.322
person.
Board members. Luke bornheimer.

00:21:25.526 --> 00:21:27.761
I missed manny's share director
eukaryal share. So I don't know

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:29.862
exactly what was said, but I

00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:32.731
gather that director director is

00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:34.835
stepping down or stepping away

00:21:35.237 --> 00:21:37.271
from the board. I'm saddened to
hear that and I really

00:21:38.573 --> 00:21:41.141
appreciate the service that
you've given our city, what

00:21:41.877 --> 00:21:44.780
you've done here, what you've
done for our city. Beyond this

00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:48.381
board. And yeah, I'm sad to hear

00:21:48.383 --> 00:21:51.520
that, but hopeful for your
future and whatever that brings.

00:21:55.924 --> 00:21:57.924
Thank you. Next speaker, please.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.562
Hi, stacy randecker. I first
just wanted to say I was so

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.631
thrilled to hear your
priorities. Director so and

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:05.698
director henderson kids, kids,

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.700
kids, kids, kids, kids. The only

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.438
thing I would say is can we also
get them to bike to school, to

00:22:11.407 --> 00:22:14.275
the bus? Is top notch. Yes. We
want muni. My kids are muni

00:22:15.178 --> 00:22:17.178
kids, but I wish they could have

00:22:18.514 --> 00:22:20.514
been bike kids to you and making

00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:22.516
places. Oh my GOD. Are we could

00:22:24.354 --> 00:22:26.354
have so many places if we just

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:29.658
prioritized people instead of
motor vehicle throughput in our

00:22:31.394 --> 00:22:33.161
city. And we really need to look
for those spaces where we can

00:22:33.929 --> 00:22:35.929
bring people together, you know,

00:22:35.998 --> 00:22:37.998
and our merchant corridors, we

00:22:38.133 --> 00:22:40.133
have so many spots and on the

00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:42.269
east side of the city is doesn't

00:22:42.972 --> 00:22:44.972
have enough. I live in potrero

00:22:44.974 --> 00:22:46.974
and it's like I have to go on

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.545
vacation to the west side to get
all the good stuff. And I'd

00:22:51.447 --> 00:22:53.447
really like it in in our side of

00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:57.151
town to do and director curio I

00:22:57.987 --> 00:23:00.856
reject that. I mean I want what
is best for you. You've been I

00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:03.358
know people weren't really they

00:23:03.927 --> 00:23:05.927
were skeptical about you joining

00:23:05.996 --> 00:23:07.729
the board. But I hope all of
those naysayers have been won

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:11.500
over. I really appreciate so
much what you've done and I

00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:15.671
guess maybe now you'll join
valencia for people. I don't

00:23:17.274 --> 00:23:19.274
know. But all the best to you.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.910
We'll MISS You. Thank you. Not

00:23:22.112 --> 00:23:24.146
seeing anyone else in the room.
Rise to speak, please open

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.918
remote comment at this time.
We'll move to remote public
comment not to exceed a total

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.521
time of ten minutes. Members of
the public wishing to comment

00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:36.159
should dial star three to enter
the queue. Each speaker will
have two minutes. Moderator for

00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:41.563
speaker. Great. Can you hear me

00:23:42.766 --> 00:23:44.766
now? Yes, go ahead. Excellent.

00:23:44.768 --> 00:23:46.768
David pilpel good afternoon. I

00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:48.903
caught the end of director

00:23:50.107 --> 00:23:52.107
jacobi's comments. I appreciate

00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:55.177
his thoughts and it's great that

00:23:56.247 --> 00:23:58.982
he's back safely and I'm sure
that he won't be too far away or

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.919
for very long. As with many, we

00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:06.522
have not always agreed, which is
fine, but I think that we

00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:10.293
respect each other deeply, and
I'm sure that we will

00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:13.462
communicate at some point soon.

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:18.101
and I wish him the best and I
think the board will be worse

00:24:21.238 --> 00:24:24.207
with his departure. Anyway,
thanks for listening on this

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.780
item. Thank you. No additional

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.248
speakers. Okay close close
public comment and please call

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.487
the next item place is you on
item number seven, the

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.359
director's report. Thank you.

00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:45.628
Directors and thank you

00:24:46.832 --> 00:24:48.832
directors. So and henderson for

00:24:49.334 --> 00:24:51.902
clarifying your priorities. A
year nearly a year ago, back in

00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:54.672
FEBRUARY, we had a board budget
workshop that we're preparing

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.941
for again and one of the most
important aspects of that

00:24:58.109 --> 00:25:00.143
workshop is hearing from board
members about your priorities,

00:25:00.778 --> 00:25:02.778
and particularly clarity about

00:25:04.583 --> 00:25:06.584
your values. That is how we make
the hard decisions about

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:09.787
allocating our increasingly
limited financial and staffing

00:25:11.757 --> 00:25:13.757
resources. So the clearer you

00:25:14.692 --> 00:25:16.794
all can be, the easier it is for
our team to make the hard

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:19.529
choices that we have to make

00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:22.100
every day. And thank you, of
course, to director curiel for

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.100
your long service and

00:25:25.871 --> 00:25:28.706
partnership on this board. As we
think about much of our work, a

00:25:29.542 --> 00:25:31.642
lot of our work is trying to
align, not only with your

00:25:31.743 --> 00:25:33.711
values, but also the mayor's
priorities, which include

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.614
delivering on our housing
responsibilities, safety and

00:25:37.616 --> 00:25:39.616
security on our streets, and

00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:41.719
also small business success and

00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:43.954
economic recovery. And one of

00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:46.591
the things, manny, that I really
appreciate about you is you

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560
understand the nature of san

00:25:49.662 --> 00:25:51.662
francisco's boom bust economy

00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.431
that the san francisco of 2018

00:25:54.634 --> 00:25:56.634
will never come back again. But

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.705
what we excel at in san
francisco is figuring out what

00:26:00.473 --> 00:26:02.473
is next and our small business

00:26:03.476 --> 00:26:05.476
leaders like lead the world at

00:26:06.112 --> 00:26:08.747
figuring out what is next of
upholding san francisco values

00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:12.851
and hopefulness and ingenuity at
all levels and scales and

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.920
bringing people together to

00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:19.225
figure out what kind of a city
do we want to be. So even though

00:26:19.225 --> 00:26:22.930
you'll no longer be playing that
role for us on the board, I know

00:26:22.895 --> 00:26:25.300
that you will be continuing to
play that role as a small

00:26:25.798 --> 00:26:28.133
business owner and as one of the
most important conveners in san

00:26:29.303 --> 00:26:31.303
francisco in these challenging

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.750
times. Now I'd like to go to my
director's report. Speaking of

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.810
small businesses, we have

00:26:39.312 --> 00:26:41.312
recently launched our tiny

00:26:41.314 --> 00:26:44.149
little marketing team led by
gene brophy here at the sfmta,

00:26:45.585 --> 00:26:47.988
launched a go local small
business campaign in partnership

00:26:47.988 --> 00:26:50.924
ship with neighborhood
associations and business

00:26:51.458 --> 00:26:54.127
associations across san
francisco and really being led

00:26:55.462 --> 00:26:57.462
from our own sfmta small

00:26:57.697 --> 00:26:59.697
business working group. So jean

00:26:59.933 --> 00:27:01.933
and her team partnered with

00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:03.968
local artist dan bransfield to

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.140
do a set of psa campaigns

00:27:08.342 --> 00:27:10.342
highlighting our city's

00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.212
amazingly vibrant and diverse
and creative small business

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.318
district, all of which are there
because of muni and muni is

00:27:20.454 --> 00:27:23.157
there because of them. As you
know, san francisco has this

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.561
unique geographic quality where
we have long, skinny

00:27:26.561 --> 00:27:29.290
neighborhood commercial
districts that follow the

00:27:29.931 --> 00:27:31.931
historic streetcar lines that

00:27:33.567 --> 00:27:35.568
muni was born from. And so small
business recovery and muni's

00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:39.671
recovery go hand in hand. And as

00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:41.842
we'll talk about later, our our
local business communities are

00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:46.120
now our main drivers of muni's
ridership growth. So we're very

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.490
happy to be promoting this this

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.554
campaign. Next up, speaking of
small businesses, we're also

00:27:55.323 --> 00:27:57.458
happy to announce that governor
newsom announced last week that

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.620
we and our partners at the
department of public works would

00:28:03.297 --> 00:28:05.297
receive a clean california grant

00:28:06.534 --> 00:28:08.534
to the tune of $3.3 million.

00:28:08.736 --> 00:28:10.736
This is focused on allowing us

00:28:12.507 --> 00:28:14.574
to take our existing efforts at
cleaning and upgrading all of

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.100
our facilities and supercharge

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.847
them so we're quite happy about
that. We'll be focused on

00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:22.415
cleaning of shelters and

00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:24.551
stations, removing graffiti,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.922
improving lighting, doing much
of the work that the team has

00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:30.958
been busy doing recently on the
t third line, where we've been

00:28:32.528 --> 00:28:34.762
upgrading, for example, all
every single one of the lighting

00:28:35.598 --> 00:28:37.598
fixtures, which are from 19

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:39.899
whatever technology in order to

00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:43.536
be more easily maintained, more

00:28:43.872 --> 00:28:45.872
energy efficient, more less

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.740
vulnerable to vandalism and

00:28:48.343 --> 00:28:50.479
brighter for our riders. So
we're going to be able to

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.680
continue doing more of this

00:28:52.715 --> 00:28:54.715
effort focused on downtown and

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.850
south of market chinatown and

00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:59.554
the muni metro system. And
thanks to existing contracts

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:01.822
that we have in place, we'll be

00:29:02.224 --> 00:29:05.260
able to begin doing this work
starting at the end of this

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.630
month. The big news for this

00:29:09.966 --> 00:29:11.966
director's report, of course, is

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.100
our legislative update. Late

00:29:14.437 --> 00:29:16.437
last saturday, OCTOBER 14th, was

00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.774
the deadline for governor newsom
to either sign or veto bills.

00:29:21.544 --> 00:29:24.120
And there was a big long list of
bills that we have been

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.682
tracking. Indeed, a long list of
bills, some of which we have had

00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:29.751
as our number one legislative

00:29:31.154 --> 00:29:33.154
priority for over a decade. And

00:29:34.123 --> 00:29:35.791
I am very pleased to announce
that the governor signed laura

00:29:38.427 --> 00:29:40.862
friedman's bill, ab 645, our top
legislator priority, which

00:29:41.765 --> 00:29:43.765
authorizes finally speed safety

00:29:44.734 --> 00:29:46.734
cameras on a limited basis in

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.206
california. California now joins
us. Most of the rest of the

00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:52.874
world and at least 18 us states,

00:29:53.443 --> 00:29:55.878
including states like
mississippi and virginia and

00:29:56.946 --> 00:29:59.716
tennessee, in legalizing ing
this basic life saving

00:30:00.651 --> 00:30:02.651
technology that can cut traffic

00:30:02.853 --> 00:30:05.821
fatalities by as much as half.
We were fortunate to have

00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:11.360
attended a celebration event
hosted by walk sf last night

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.630
that included a based basically

00:30:17.145 --> 00:30:19.602
the entire spectrum of policy
makers here in san francisco,
members of our board, many

00:30:20.504 --> 00:30:22.504
members of our staff, families

00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:24.506
for safe streets and advocates

00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:27.610
from all over san francisco, all
of whom came together under a

00:30:30.347 --> 00:30:32.347
quite big tent in order to

00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:35.118
continually expand the coalition
of people who could support this

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.820
this measure by listening to

00:30:38.156 --> 00:30:40.857
them carefully and by
incremental adjustments to the

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:42.958
legislation to the point where

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.763
it finally got signed. So thank
you to all of you, and
particularly jerry ekin, for

00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:49.731
your support. There's a couple

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.200
of other bills that also got

00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:56.940
signed. Ab 361 now allows local
agencies like us to install

00:30:57.642 --> 00:30:59.642
forward facing cameras on city

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.979
owned vehicles to enforce double
parking in the bike lanes,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.140
something that we have long

00:31:05.316 --> 00:31:07.651
wanted to be able to expedite.
This technology will

00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:10.220
dramatically increase the
efficiency of our parking

00:31:10.856 --> 00:31:12.856
control officers and allow us to

00:31:13.124 --> 00:31:15.124
make a bigger effort there. The

00:31:16.628 --> 00:31:19.596
governor also signed ab 434,
which seeks to reduce harassment

00:31:20.498 --> 00:31:23.367
of women and other vulnerable
groups on public transit by

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.350
collecting better data related

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.380
to these incidents. This builds

00:31:28.774 --> 00:31:31.475
basically it's modeled after the
work that we have already been

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.710
doing here at the sfmta, but it

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:36.946
requires us, other agencies like

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:40.149
ours to do similar work, that

00:31:40.952 --> 00:31:43.120
together we will be able to do
better by having consistent data

00:31:45.224 --> 00:31:47.358
across the state and therefore
the goal being to attract

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.760
additional resources since the

00:31:50.229 --> 00:31:52.229
safety of women and girls and

00:31:53.332 --> 00:31:55.332
children are high priorities for

00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:59.669
this agency. Ab 413 was also

00:31:59.905 --> 00:32:02.700
signed into law. Again taking
work that we'd already been

00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:04.208
doing around daylighting here at

00:32:04.477 --> 00:32:06.978
the sfmta and making that state
law. It prohibits drivers from

00:32:07.847 --> 00:32:09.847
parking or stopping within 20ft

00:32:10.382 --> 00:32:12.382
of a crosswalk with a bunch of

00:32:13.318 --> 00:32:15.318
very specific exceptions. Other

00:32:17.222 --> 00:32:20.158
news we are collaborating with
the police department, the

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:22.159
district attorney's office and

00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:24.496
other agencies, ces, in order to
support their efforts around

00:32:25.531 --> 00:32:28.233
reducing vehicle break ins. We
have found ways to take

00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:30.901
advantage of our new parking

00:32:30.936 --> 00:32:33.771
meter technology to include
messages on our parking meter

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.740
screens, directing people to not

00:32:36.876 --> 00:32:39.678
leave their valuables in the
car. Those messages will be

00:32:40.647 --> 00:32:42.647
available in english and spanish

00:32:43.116 --> 00:32:45.250
and in chinese within a couple
of weeks. We're also adding

00:32:46.786 --> 00:32:48.786
messages to the pay by phone app

00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:52.490
screen. And then finally, I
wanted to report on our ongoing

00:32:53.627 --> 00:32:56.329
efforts to address state of good
repair and our deferred

00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:58.329
maintenance backlog throughout

00:32:58.632 --> 00:33:00.966
the system. One of the things
that I have directed staff to do

00:33:01.568 --> 00:33:03.568
throughout the agency is to be

00:33:03.737 --> 00:33:06.405
very clear about the condition.
One of our most important

00:33:07.307 --> 00:33:09.307
infrastructure. And so they have

00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:11.642
been dutifully investigating the

00:33:11.778 --> 00:33:13.979
reality of all of the vulnerable
cities that we face throughout

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.918
the system. And so the team, um,
completed the most extensive

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.420
inspection of our over 100 and

00:33:22.422 --> 00:33:24.422
over 100 year old twin peaks

00:33:24.691 --> 00:33:26.792
tunnel, the most detailed
inspection that we had done in

00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:31.631
almost 50 years, including not
only looking at all of the

00:33:31.698 --> 00:33:34.434
structure, but actually getting
behind the structure into the

00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:36.701
plenum space between the tunnel

00:33:37.237 --> 00:33:39.237
structure and the raw rock. And

00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:41.873
in some cases old growth redwood

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:44.142
beams that exist between the

00:33:44.378 --> 00:33:46.378
tunnel structure and the rock.

00:33:48.516 --> 00:33:50.950
This is an old tunnel. They were
also able to obtain all of the

00:33:51.786 --> 00:33:54.687
records of all of the previous
repairs have been done over the

00:33:54.788 --> 00:33:56.788
last 100 years and we're

00:33:57.224 --> 00:33:58.824
actually so grateful to our
predecessors for keeping such

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.270
extreme, ordinarily good records

00:34:02.662 --> 00:34:04.898
on the state of the
infrastructure. It reminds us of

00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:06.899
the responsibilities that we

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:09.769
have to our successors. The team

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.338
completed very, very
microscopically detailed lidar

00:34:13.674 --> 00:34:15.674
surveys and created a full 3d

00:34:16.177 --> 00:34:18.611
model of the tunnel. They found.
Let me cut to the chase about

00:34:18.913 --> 00:34:20.947
the findings. So there are no
immediate safety issues, which

00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:24.917
is a huge relief to me. But the

00:34:25.487 --> 00:34:27.588
tunnel is really old and it is
starting to distort. This was

00:34:28.523 --> 00:34:30.657
something that was noticed 50
years ago and that distortion

00:34:31.426 --> 00:34:34.361
has continued a little bit. It
will require some adjustments.

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.398
And so what we're having the
time now to do in a

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.301
non-emergency way is actually
figure out exactly what

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.439
adjustments are needed, what
strengthening. We're also,

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:47.574
because of the lidar testing,

00:34:47.976 --> 00:34:50.577
can keep very, very close track
so that we know if the urgency

00:34:52.213 --> 00:34:54.981
level increases and therefore we
need to speed up repairs or if

00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:58.919
it's been 50 years, it can go

00:34:59.254 --> 00:35:02.189
another 50 years without us
needing to do much. So we are

00:35:04.493 --> 00:35:06.995
now working on the next phase of
the project, which is to

00:35:06.995 --> 00:35:08.996
investigate what are the
appropriate corrective actions

00:35:09.698 --> 00:35:11.899
and when those might happen, and
then to incorporate that into

00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:17.171
our capital planning and that is

00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:22.210
the end of my report. Thank you.
Director tumlin directors, do
you have questions or comments

00:35:23.278 --> 00:35:26.470
on the director's report?
Director you could tell I don't

00:35:26.615 --> 00:35:28.782
know if you mentioned this in
your report, but maybe you can.

00:35:29.951 --> 00:35:31.920
There were some. Well, it has to
do with governor newsom. There

00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:34.556
was some money that was
allocated to us to clean the bus

00:35:35.558 --> 00:35:38.227
shelters. That's right. Did you
talk about that just now? I did.

00:35:38.227 --> 00:35:40.227
That was the clean california.

00:35:41.797 --> 00:35:43.797
Was I just spacing out? Okay no,

00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:48.569
no, no. That was the clean
california grant. $3.3 million.

00:35:52.642 --> 00:35:55.510
Yes I saw that. But how are we
planning on using it? So we are

00:35:55.745 --> 00:35:58.546
working together with the
department of public works. So

00:35:59.882 --> 00:36:02.170
part of the money will go to
supplies and equipment and so on

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.286
for our own staff. A part of it
will go to some existing

00:36:06.323 --> 00:36:08.323
contractors that we have that we

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.590
already had on contract to help

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.300
facilitate it. Catching up with
some deferred cleaning. But like

00:36:15.932 --> 00:36:18.167
how how do you think the san
francisco public will know? Will

00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:20.569
they notice it? How could they
notice a difference with this

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:23.205
additional money? Well, what we
hope is that folks will start

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.375
noticing a difference like we're
folks are starting to notice a

00:36:27.444 --> 00:36:29.845
difference on the t third line.
So the upgrade the steady

00:36:32.282 --> 00:36:34.450
upgrading just our crews were
out there. They removed all the

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.180
rust from the railings that had

00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:40.890
been there since the 90s. We
repainted everything. We changed

00:36:40.858 --> 00:36:42.858
it all the light fixtures. We

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.928
removed all of the graffiti for
the ad panels and maps. We were

00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:49.331
able to replace, like the clear

00:36:49.766 --> 00:36:51.766
covers that kind of gotten sun

00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:57.439
damage over time. So the goal is

00:36:57.741 --> 00:37:00.577
a thousand small improvements
rather than 1 or 2 really big

00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:04.470
improvements. The goal is to
bring everything up to a state

00:37:04.315 --> 00:37:07.150
of cleanliness that that we
would expect in a city like san

00:37:07.952 --> 00:37:10.860
francisco. Okay. And then my
second question and forgive me

00:37:11.788 --> 00:37:13.788
if you've also already said this

00:37:13.858 --> 00:37:15.858
, but when do you think the city

00:37:16.527 --> 00:37:19.262
can expect to start to see the
implementation of the speed

00:37:19.663 --> 00:37:21.663
safety cameras, the speed safety

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.334
cameras? The law doesn't go into
effect until next year, and it

00:37:25.102 --> 00:37:27.303
requires us a series of part of
the compromise of getting the

00:37:28.305 --> 00:37:30.305
bill passed was the requirements

00:37:30.808 --> 00:37:32.808
for a series of equity studies

00:37:34.479 --> 00:37:37.281
and community engagement and a
lot of discussion around

00:37:38.616 --> 00:37:40.616
placement. So right now, the

00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:43.687
team has already gotten started.
I been under the assumption that

00:37:43.821 --> 00:37:45.821
the governor was going to sign

00:37:46.324 --> 00:37:48.325
the bill. The team had gotten
started and developing a

00:37:48.392 --> 00:37:50.794
detailed timeline as well as
getting ready to make asks of

00:37:51.363 --> 00:37:53.363
other organized actions for ways

00:37:53.799 --> 00:37:55.866
of being able to help us shorten
that timeline. The team is

00:37:56.434 --> 00:37:58.434
committed to san francisco being

00:37:58.637 --> 00:38:00.738
the first to having cameras in
place. Great. Thank you very

00:38:00.805 --> 00:38:02.805
much. Thank you. Director

00:38:04.108 --> 00:38:06.108
hemminger, please. Thank you,

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.110
MADAM Chair. And maybe I'll

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.580
begin where my colleague ended

00:38:11.717 --> 00:38:14.585
on the speed cameras and I do
want to congratulate you, jeff,

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.540
and your team, for getting the

00:38:18.657 --> 00:38:20.991
bill through a fairly, at times
hostile environment in

00:38:25.664 --> 00:38:27.664
sacramento and I'm. I was a

00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:30.501
skeptic. I think, to begin with,

00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:33.271
that we would get there and
we've gotten there. So I do want

00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:36.606
to thank you thank our mutual

00:38:36.642 --> 00:38:38.642
employee, kate breen, who made

00:38:39.711 --> 00:38:41.711
her this her life's work in the

00:38:42.314 --> 00:38:45.183
last five years. And I'm glad we
are where we are. One thing that

00:38:46.785 --> 00:38:49.721
would be helpful to me to try to
assess this is a pilot project

00:38:51.957 --> 00:38:54.759
right? It's time limited. So
we've got to go out there and do

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.996
the best we can and then we'll
go back and go through the

00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:01.531
mother MAY game again, given the

00:39:03.436 --> 00:39:05.436
fact that it is a pilot. What I

00:39:05.805 --> 00:39:08.706
wanted to know is, is we're
we're limited to 33 of these

00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:14.579
devices is what what would the
number be if we were just

00:39:15.247 --> 00:39:17.247
skipping a pilot and just

00:39:17.783 --> 00:39:19.783
implementing this as a citywide?

00:39:21.788 --> 00:39:23.788
I'd project how many how many

00:39:24.257 --> 00:39:26.257
cameras would we be looking at?

00:39:28.728 --> 00:39:31.697
100, 234. I mean, what's how big
is this pilot? That's what I'm

00:39:32.899 --> 00:39:34.899
asking. I mean, the authorized

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.600
pilot is indeed small and one of
the things that we are focused

00:39:40.807 --> 00:39:42.807
on is making sure that the pilot

00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:45.878
is successful in order to create
the case that we can go back to

00:39:45.945 --> 00:39:47.846
the legislature and either
continue it or expand the

00:39:49.516 --> 00:39:51.383
program. And that means not only
demonstrating success in

00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:55.880
reducing speeding and reducing
traffic violence, but also

00:39:57.958 --> 00:40:00.920
addressing many of the fears
that opponents had put forward

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.950
around privacy and equity. And

00:40:05.132 --> 00:40:07.132
that's those are two key.

00:40:07.133 --> 00:40:09.133
Consider asians in the bill

00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:11.871
language itself that we are
ready to focus on demonstrating

00:40:13.107 --> 00:40:15.107
that we can protect the privacy

00:40:15.242 --> 00:40:18.440
of individuals and make sure
that this technology is not

00:40:18.812 --> 00:40:20.812
being used to create more harm

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:24.516
for people who had been targeted

00:40:25.986 --> 00:40:27.986
in in in in traffic stops in the

00:40:31.825 --> 00:40:33.825
past. So it is a pilot, but can

00:40:34.129 --> 00:40:36.129
you characteri size it for me at

00:40:41.168 --> 00:40:43.168
all? We believe. 10% or 10. I

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.470
mean, how big how big is this

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.975
relative to what we would need
as a citywide program? This is a

00:40:50.745 --> 00:40:52.745
very small pilot, right? So

00:40:52.847 --> 00:40:55.415
we're limited to 33 cameras. We
have a lot more intersections in

00:40:56.784 --> 00:40:58.784
our high injury network than 33.

00:41:00.254 --> 00:41:02.254
So one of the things that we are

00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:04.356
hoping to be able to test with

00:41:04.893 --> 00:41:06.893
this pilot is efficacy as well

00:41:07.762 --> 00:41:09.762
as trust. And if we are

00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:12.299
successful, feel like this
should be one of our primary

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.400
tools for addressing the worst
cause of traffic violence, which

00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:19.772
is excessive speed by people

00:41:20.843 --> 00:41:23.770
driving cars. But I mean, you're
just indicating that we've we've

00:41:25.314 --> 00:41:27.314
got a fairly long road to hoe.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.984
Correct. To get to that kind of
answer, get it back to

00:41:30.886 --> 00:41:32.886
sacramento and then scale it up

00:41:33.488 --> 00:41:35.488
right? That's right. And that's

00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.291
why we appreciate the extreme

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.270
patience and inexhaustibility of

00:41:42.131 --> 00:41:44.131
people like kate breen, who just

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.401
kept coming back again and again
until we got this passed and so

00:41:48.337 --> 00:41:50.805
the sooner we can demonstrate
success, the easier it is to go

00:41:51.607 --> 00:41:54.508
back to the legislature. Well
and look, I know I've been a bit

00:41:55.511 --> 00:41:57.511
of a broken record about this,

00:41:57.547 --> 00:41:59.547
but I think it's also the case
that this pilot is not going to

00:42:02.384 --> 00:42:05.320
scale soon enough and big enough
to dent the numbers that we keep

00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:08.155
seeing every week and month,

00:42:09.324 --> 00:42:11.492
which to me means we've got to
keep banging on the police

00:42:14.263 --> 00:42:17.132
department to help us enforce
this. The law that's right. The

00:42:18.901 --> 00:42:21.803
speed cameras have a lot of
benefit from them for a lot of

00:42:24.507 --> 00:42:26.941
reasons, but they're we're five
years away. It sounds like to

00:42:27.676 --> 00:42:29.676
me, before we've got something

00:42:29.979 --> 00:42:32.615
that we can really make a dent
with. That's right. So this is

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.850
we have achieved one major win

00:42:37.287 --> 00:42:39.287
in our legislative program. We

00:42:39.455 --> 00:42:41.455
have a long list of other

00:42:41.624 --> 00:42:43.624
desired legislative changes that

00:42:45.494 --> 00:42:47.494
we could also make. And I think

00:42:47.663 --> 00:42:49.663
following from the lessons of

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.900
particularly the european union,

00:42:52.268 --> 00:42:55.370
one which has not faced that the
dramatically escalating rates of

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:57.639
traffic violence that we have in
the united states, but is

00:42:57.707 --> 00:42:59.707
instead actually address the

00:42:59.943 --> 00:43:01.943
problem they address the problem

00:43:02.946 --> 00:43:04.946
through a long list of

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.317
legislative changes that we are
eager to see. Also here in the

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:10.285
united states and in california.

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:12.287
Thank you. And just a quick

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.289
question on another subject,

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:17.259
which is the twin peaks tunnel.
The I didn't hear you say the

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:21.463
word seismic was was that part
of the assessment that we made

00:43:22.165 --> 00:43:24.134
of that tunnel and its
stability? Yes. So we

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:26.970
investigate it. All of the
conditions, both the seismic

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:30.840
condition. There's a lot of
water. There's a whole river in

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.710
the tunnel that we need to
understand and manage around.

00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:38.346
There is there's the concrete

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:41.284
itself. There's the structure
between the concrete and the

00:43:43.855 --> 00:43:45.855
rock wall. There's also the very

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.580
old anchors for the overhead

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:53.396
wire. And of course, everything
related to the track bed and the

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:55.398
switches, although that was work
that we had addressed

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:58.233
previously. So the focus was the

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:00.570
structure itself. Okay. Thank

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.738
you, MADAM Chair. Thank you.

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.575
Director kahina, please. Thank

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.778
you. Chair ekin. Question about

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.810
ab 4346 is the bill against the

00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:14.951
harassment of women? So just
wanted to get more context on

00:44:17.122 --> 00:44:19.122
how how the passing of this bill

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.525
will expand our efforts to make
transit safer for both operators

00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:24.427
and for riders. That's right.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.290
And the focus of the bill is

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.865
collecting data. So the best way

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:32.869
for us to be able to help
ourselves allocate our limited

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.600
resources, but also so be

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.420
transparent to the public about

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:42.446
how we're how what our need is
and how we're addressing that

00:44:43.715 --> 00:44:45.816
need is, is by collecting data
and then being transparent about

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:50.487
that data. So some of the work
that our security chief,

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.490
kimberly burris, just did this

00:44:54.593 --> 00:44:56.593
week is creating a new set of

00:44:57.362 --> 00:44:59.362
dashboards around operator and

00:44:59.464 --> 00:45:01.464
parking control officer assaults

00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:03.767
because that is a core part of

00:45:03.835 --> 00:45:05.835
our effort at addressing safety

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.870
is both the street users and

00:45:08.107 --> 00:45:10.107
transit riders, but also our

00:45:11.811 --> 00:45:14.450
employees. And so we have been
working to get way ahead of this

00:45:14.814 --> 00:45:16.814
bill to make sure that we've got

00:45:17.583 --> 00:45:19.584
solid data around the passenger
experience and our employee

00:45:21.587 --> 00:45:23.587
experience. You can find our

00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.491
muni passenger safety data
online. Already we have

00:45:28.994 --> 00:45:30.994
published that broadly. It is at

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.166
, I believe it's. At
sfmta.Com/muni data, but you can

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200
certainly search for muni safety

00:45:39.972 --> 00:45:42.106
data and we publish our safety
incidents per 100,000 miles by

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.178
category and they're in two
different categories. They're in

00:45:47.347 --> 00:45:50.248
the top. There's a pull down
menu and you could look at the

00:45:52.285 --> 00:45:54.285
historic data tracking a long,

00:45:54.387 --> 00:45:57.255
long time back. Plus the new,
more recent data where we

00:45:58.491 --> 00:46:01.293
expanded our definition of
assault. So one of the things

00:46:01.795 --> 00:46:04.263
that was very clear that was
important to our security chief

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.800
is we need to include assault,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.505
not just, you know, exterior
facing violence that's going to

00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:15.739
require a trip to the hospital,

00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:18.776
but also experiencing harassment

00:46:19.312 --> 00:46:21.312
on muni because that it's that

00:46:23.483 --> 00:46:26.152
whole array of experiences that
folks face on muni that

00:46:26.987 --> 00:46:29.889
determines whether they feel
safe and comfortable and
therefore are willing to ride.

00:46:31.391 --> 00:46:33.692
So we expanded our definition in
order to make sure that we are

00:46:35.463 --> 00:46:37.463
fully encompassing all of those

00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:40.867
factors. So with the passing of
this particular bill, the

00:46:42.836 --> 00:46:45.571
signing of this bill, this
effort is now expanded statewide

00:46:45.672 --> 00:46:47.672
. That's right. So does that

00:46:47.808 --> 00:46:49.808
mean that we can now share data

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.544
across agencies and work with
different law enforcement

00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:55.482
jurisdictions? Or how does how
does that connection get

00:46:56.584 --> 00:46:58.752
created? Yeah, I don't know the
details of how that connection

00:47:00.387 --> 00:47:02.389
gets created, but what the bill
sets is standard ised data

00:47:02.389 --> 00:47:05.258
collection efforts which we will
be complying with. And then

00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:09.996
ideally that helps us create a
stronger case and stronger

00:47:09.996 --> 00:47:11.996
coalition at the state level to

00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:14.767
get both funding as well as

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.838
legislative changes to address
the core problems. And that's

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.241
great because we have a few
different transit systems that

00:47:21.842 --> 00:47:23.842
operate within san francisco.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.247
And so it's great to see that.
Now we have a statewide effort

00:47:28.249 --> 00:47:30.249
to make all transit safer for

00:47:32.387 --> 00:47:35.355
riders. Thank you. Thank you.
Director henderson, please.

00:47:37.692 --> 00:47:39.692
Thank you, chair. I just had a

00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:44.364
question about ab 361. The or
whichever number it is about the

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.135
front facing cameras is there or
do you have an idea of what the

00:47:49.104 --> 00:47:51.104
financial impact would be to

00:47:51.907 --> 00:47:54.608
implement that? I thought that
that existed already. So is

00:47:55.243 --> 00:47:57.243
there a capital expenditure that

00:47:58.446 --> 00:48:01.248
is going to have to that you
anticipate now that this is

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.118
authorized? Yeah. So we have
forward facing cameras on our

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.823
muni busses that allow us to
enforce double parking in the

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.250
transit lane. This effective

00:48:12.393 --> 00:48:14.995
takes that same authorization in
and gives us the ability to put

00:48:15.931 --> 00:48:17.998
cameras in our other vehicles to
enforce double parking in the

00:48:19.401 --> 00:48:21.401
bike lane. And so we would use

00:48:21.637 --> 00:48:24.606
the basically the same
techniques where we have pico

00:48:24.607 --> 00:48:26.607
parking control officers who

00:48:26.875 --> 00:48:29.710
review video at extreme fast
forward and then stop and then

00:48:31.647 --> 00:48:33.647
manually issue a citation. There

00:48:33.649 --> 00:48:35.649
is a pretty significant cost to

00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:37.951
adding vehicle, adding cameras

00:48:38.454 --> 00:48:40.454
to our vehicles. But as we know

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.825
from the cameras that are on our
transit vehicles, there's also

00:48:46.896 --> 00:48:49.664
significant benefit. Well beyond
being able to enforce illegal

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.169
parking. The. 11 or 12 cameras
on our transit vehicles are a

00:48:55.672 --> 00:48:57.672
critical component of our

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.700
efforts to address both safety

00:49:01.944 --> 00:49:03.944
as well as crime. And that data,

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.150
when it's reported to the police
department in time we can save

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.840
our video data and use that for

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.820
evidence in any kind of

00:49:13.957 --> 00:49:15.957
investigation. Okay. Thank you.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.460
Thank you, director. So. I'll

00:49:19.963 --> 00:49:22.764
make it really short, but I
wanted to ask something else

00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:25.333
that you mentioned about how we

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.870
can help with with car thieves

00:49:30.974 --> 00:49:32.974
in the city. And I'd like to see

00:49:34.544 --> 00:49:36.544
if I read an article recently

00:49:36.913 --> 00:49:38.913
last week about how this lady

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:42.350
were able to find her stolen car

00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:44.619
through looking at the her

00:49:46.856 --> 00:49:48.856
citations on her car wreck

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.930
record. So director tumblin, I

00:49:51.628 --> 00:49:54.464
wonder what can we do to help
people get their stolen car back

00:49:56.867 --> 00:49:59.802
and then how are we how can we
alleviate these financial

00:50:02.939 --> 00:50:04.939
burdens of those tickets that

00:50:05.443 --> 00:50:07.443
these poor car owners end up

00:50:09.479 --> 00:50:12.415
having to live with? But they
weren't the one that actually

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.150
make the decision to park in an

00:50:15.953 --> 00:50:17.953
illegal spot. So how can we help

00:50:18.121 --> 00:50:20.121
them and also maybe work

00:50:20.724 --> 00:50:22.724
together with sfpd and it just

00:50:23.594 --> 00:50:26.496
leave it all to you? An open
ended question. Yes. No, that's

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.980
a very timely question. So the

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.802
mayor issued a directive last
week following that san

00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:36.473
francisco chronicle story
ordering us to collaborate with

00:50:36.473 --> 00:50:39.275
the san francisco police
department to make sure that we

00:50:39.944 --> 00:50:41.944
that our databases could talk to

00:50:42.947 --> 00:50:45.816
each other and that we could not
only identify stolen vehicles,

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:50.319
but also like not not cite the

00:50:50.921 --> 00:50:53.456
owner of the rightful owner of
that vehicle for a violation.

00:50:55.826 --> 00:50:57.826
This has caused us to do an

00:50:58.497 --> 00:51:01.365
investigate mission into why we
are no longer able to do that.

00:51:02.233 --> 00:51:04.233
So we used to be able to

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.671
automatically do that and I was
mistaken in the underlying

00:51:09.173 --> 00:51:11.241
reasons why. So one of the
things that I had understood was

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.210
that the city's privacy

00:51:16.215 --> 00:51:19.183
ordinance was an obstacle that
is not correct from our current

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.850
understanding that there is an

00:51:22.421 --> 00:51:24.721
administrative process that we
MAY need to go through in order

00:51:25.457 --> 00:51:27.457
to allow databases to talk to

00:51:28.426 --> 00:51:30.426
each other. But the burden for

00:51:30.662 --> 00:51:32.662
solving this problem is on the

00:51:34.266 --> 00:51:36.868
sfmta. So we had legacy software
that we had been using that

00:51:37.903 --> 00:51:40.671
software is no longer being
maintained. And so what we need

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.840
to do is just defined the api or

00:51:44.576 --> 00:51:47.378
updated software in order to
allow the databases to talk to

00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:49.713
each other. Again and that work

00:51:50.249 --> 00:51:52.249
is the responsibility of the

00:51:52.318 --> 00:51:54.318
sfmta and we are working hard on

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.320
it. And in the meantime, um, we

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.290
do try to make it very easy. So

00:52:00.459 --> 00:52:03.610
sometimes as our parking control
officers make mistakes or

00:52:03.862 --> 00:52:06.764
sometimes a motorist was doing
something in good faith and

00:52:06.765 --> 00:52:08.765
inadvertently gets a parking

00:52:09.502 --> 00:52:11.502
citation, we try to make it very

00:52:12.138 --> 00:52:14.138
easy to protest citations and

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.340
many citations can be dismissed

00:52:16.809 --> 00:52:18.809
administratively. So so there's

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.780
a form online that's easy to
find just sfmta dismissed

00:52:22.481 --> 00:52:24.481
parking citation or protest

00:52:25.652 --> 00:52:27.652
citation and so long as somebody

00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:30.589
has evidence, it's like a police
report that my car was stolen.

00:52:31.991 --> 00:52:34.359
It is very easy for us to
dismiss those citations that

00:52:35.628 --> 00:52:37.628
were that were written despite

00:52:38.297 --> 00:52:40.765
the good faith of the individual
motorist. We don't. We don't

00:52:41.667 --> 00:52:43.667
ever want to be in the position

00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:46.271
of compounding harm that our

00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:49.141
residents face. Uh, yeah. I
trust that we don't want to do

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.311
that. And I just wanted to see
if anything that you need. The

00:52:54.514 --> 00:52:56.514
board's help to continue to

00:52:57.116 --> 00:52:59.116
expedite that effort. I think

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.920
that will we're all open here to

00:53:02.923 --> 00:53:05.758
help you. Yes both thank you for
that. The board of supervisors

00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:08.226
includes PRESIDENT Peskin has

00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:11.197
expressed as well the desire
that if there's any legislative

00:53:12.132 --> 00:53:15.340
fix that's necessary, that we
will fix it. I believe all of

00:53:16.102 --> 00:53:18.102
the problem rest on my shoulders

00:53:20.574 --> 00:53:23.176
and with with our staff team. So
we will get moving on making

00:53:25.946 --> 00:53:27.946
that happen. Thank you. Thank

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.351
you, director. So, um, I just
wanted to comment also on the

00:53:34.822 --> 00:53:36.822
just pause on the ab 645 victory

00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:39.993
as well. Colleagues, I attended
the celebration event that

00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:44.697
walkoff put on last night and

00:53:44.832 --> 00:53:47.330
I'm sort of still pinching
myself that this is the world

00:53:48.435 --> 00:53:50.670
that we're living in now, which
is a world where something we

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.974
thought for so long was not
possible is in fact not come to

00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:56.710
pass. It's really quite
remarkable. And I do want to

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.414
just shout out continued to
staff kate breen, though she's

00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:03.350
on vacation. Katie angotti,
though she just had a baby when

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.387
no ricardo julia for their work
shaping the bill and of course

00:54:09.891 --> 00:54:11.891
just you jeff for having the

00:54:12.594 --> 00:54:15.162
sharp focus and reminding people
again and again this is such a

00:54:16.431 --> 00:54:18.965
barrier to our efforts. And also
just for putting in the work

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:21.501
yourself and making trips to
sacramento and getting this

00:54:22.103 --> 00:54:24.337
across the finish line. I also
want to just acknowledge the

00:54:25.273 --> 00:54:27.273
mayor and her staff for coming

00:54:27.976 --> 00:54:30.244
out early in support on this
bill and that encouraged so many

00:54:31.546 --> 00:54:33.614
other cities to get on board.
And then just thank you to the

00:54:34.249 --> 00:54:36.150
staff, the advocates and
community and anybody else who

00:54:37.919 --> 00:54:40.254
did anything else to get this
bill across the finish line.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.257
It's really a remarkable victory
, and I hope we can all just

00:54:43.724 --> 00:54:45.724
really pause and celebrate this

00:54:46.862 --> 00:54:49.630
moment. That's all I had. If
there are no other director

00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:51.933
comments, I'm going to open it
up for public comment on the

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.875
director report. Sorry, that's

00:55:03.512 --> 00:55:05.512
going to be item nine is not is

00:55:05.948 --> 00:55:07.948
so we're on seven now, then

00:55:13.389 --> 00:55:15.389
eight, then nine. Yep. Hi. Board

00:55:15.858 --> 00:55:17.858
members. Luke bornheimer first,

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.294
I want to thank director tomlin
staff and the board, especially

00:55:20.696 --> 00:55:22.696
chair ekin and walk san

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:25.133
francisco and the san francisco
bicycle coalition for their work

00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:29.370
and advocacy on ab 645 and speed
enforcement cameras. Speed

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.807
enforcement cameras will make
the 33 streets that they're

00:55:33.943 --> 00:55:35.943
installed on likely in 2025

00:55:36.345 --> 00:55:39.148
safer. That said, there's no
good reason to wait until 2025

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.820
to install these cameras or more

00:55:42.318 --> 00:55:44.853
red light cameras, which the
agency hasn't used its full

00:55:45.655 --> 00:55:47.655
authority to install more of or

00:55:48.491 --> 00:55:51.161
install faster. And we need the
agency to choose locations for

00:55:51.161 --> 00:55:53.161
speed enforcement cameras and
install them as soon as

00:55:53.262 --> 00:55:55.262
possible. Ideally in the first

00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:58.367
half of 2024 since director
hemminger mentioned arm traffic

00:55:59.135 --> 00:56:01.303
enforcement by sfpd, I think
it's important to highlight what

00:56:01.905 --> 00:56:04.730
we know will make our streets
safer and directly address our

00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:07.309
roadway safety crisis, as well
as our climate crisis. Our

00:56:07.543 --> 00:56:10.479
public health crisis and car
traffic and noise and air

00:56:10.546 --> 00:56:13.449
pollution in our city. The
single best thing we can do to

00:56:13.884 --> 00:56:16.486
address this all of these things
is create a connected network of

00:56:16.486 --> 00:56:18.554
protected bike lanes throughout
our city, starting construction

00:56:18.822 --> 00:56:20.822
immediately be a connected

00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:22.992
network of protected bike lanes
will make more people feel safe

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.761
using bikes, scooters and other
forms of active transportation

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.664
to get around our city. And we
can start creating that

00:56:28.732 --> 00:56:31.134
connected network of protected
bike lanes. Now for example, by

00:56:31.702 --> 00:56:34.605
agendizing and approving the
17th street quick build project,

00:56:34.605 --> 00:56:36.472
which has been purposefully
delayed through private

00:56:37.775 --> 00:56:40.900
discussions within the city. We
do not need to wait for the

00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:42.812
active communities plan to be
finalized and approved. We can

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.749
and should start immediately. I
urge you to direct director

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.919
tumlin and staff to start
installing a connected network

00:56:48.953 --> 00:56:50.953
of protected bike lanes

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.390
immediately. We need you to lead
for our city in the planet.

00:56:53.557 --> 00:56:55.557
Thank you. Thank you. Next

00:57:01.164 --> 00:57:03.164
speaker, please. Hi, stacy

00:57:03.167 --> 00:57:05.167
randecker and ditto all of that

00:57:05.169 --> 00:57:08.710
that luke just said. And
director tomlin, I think you

00:57:08.106 --> 00:57:11.700
forgot to mention the
sponsorship of the san francisco

00:57:11.576 --> 00:57:14.244
city football club. It's a
brilliant placement for muni.

00:57:14.378 --> 00:57:16.378
I'm glad to see it. I'm a

00:57:16.514 --> 00:57:18.381
potrero mom of a footballer who
practices at beach chalet. If we

00:57:19.383 --> 00:57:22.218
could get travel times to and
from all of our soccer pitches

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.220
to 45 minutes or less, it would

00:57:24.889 --> 00:57:26.889
be truly golden. And about our

00:57:26.958 --> 00:57:29.926
small business owners, can we
turn those merchant corridors

00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:32.795
into pedestrian ized places? If

00:57:33.764 --> 00:57:35.866
busses are not easily rerouted,
making it transit only is

00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:39.636
possible. Cities all over the
world do this, including the

00:57:40.872 --> 00:57:43.841
very exotic san jose who has
transit on a pedestrian ized

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:46.810
plaza. If we really want to do

00:57:47.612 --> 00:57:50.115
right by our by our merchants,
we would look to the throngs of

00:57:50.115 --> 00:57:52.182
people that are out for every
sunday streets saturdays on

00:57:53.251 --> 00:57:55.586
valencia, weekends on hayes and
that glorious night market that

00:57:56.521 --> 00:57:59.290
was out in the sunset. We can
get goods to merchants. We can

00:58:00.392 --> 00:58:03.270
ensure accessibility for those
who need it. We need these

00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:05.161
spaces for the vibrancy of san

00:58:05.464 --> 00:58:07.398
francisco and to meet our safety
and climate goals. Could we

00:58:08.467 --> 00:58:11.168
please stop wringing our hands
on this and get moving to work

00:58:13.872 --> 00:58:15.872
for everyone? And yay for speed

00:58:17.376 --> 00:58:19.444
cameras? But and we will always
need something like this. But

00:58:19.512 --> 00:58:22.313
streets with concrete protected
bike lanes, concrete diverters

00:58:24.716 --> 00:58:26.716
at the ends every few blocks and

00:58:26.818 --> 00:58:29.754
chicanes with manny's redwood
groves are impossible to speed

00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:34.559
upon. Thank you. Thank you. Any
other speakers in the room on

00:58:35.628 --> 00:58:37.628
the director's report? Otherwise

00:58:37.663 --> 00:58:40.465
let's open, please. Remote at
this time we'll move to remote

00:58:40.633 --> 00:58:42.633
public comment not to exceed a

00:58:43.368 --> 00:58:45.690
total time of ten minutes.
Members of the public wishing to

00:58:45.571 --> 00:58:48.339
comment should dial star three
to enter the queue. Each speaker

00:58:48.574 --> 00:58:50.574
will have two minutes. Moderator

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:00.519
for speaker. Thank you. I hope
you can hear me. Chair amanda,

00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:05.490
you can o. Olivia dew point for
the record, she and her I talk

00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:07.960
about the director's report.
Very good report. I'm excited

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:12.630
about the lighting improvements.

00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:14.867
I'm very cognizant of that when
I'm in the stations and tunnels

00:59:16.903 --> 00:59:18.903
and just want to get the best

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:21.839
technology that we can. I have

00:59:23.176 --> 00:59:25.176
actually have entire led

00:59:27.548 --> 00:59:29.548
lighting in my home. So it works

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.180
and the tunnel work is very,

00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:36.221
very important to me. You know,
hear people talk much about

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:39.524
that. But I'm very passionate
about the tunnel and it's not

00:59:42.463 --> 00:59:45.980
easy getting across the city. If
there's issues with that tunnel.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.802
My resume with the twin peaks
tunnel is not very long. Going

00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:54.172
back to about 2009. But I do

00:59:55.108 --> 00:59:58.430
have 43 years of experience
using the north river tunnels,

01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:03.717
which are under the hudson river
between new york and new jersey.

01:00:04.285 --> 01:00:06.285
And they were opened in NOVEMBER

01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:08.687
of 1910. And they are really

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:10.856
getting old and sometimes it's

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.893
scary riding through those. I
rode through those a couple of

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:17.730
weeks ago. And so we don't want
to let our tunnel get to that

01:00:19.567 --> 01:00:22.436
point. And yes, there were some
other issues with in new york

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:27.674
city with the superstorm, but
still, we have to keep after the

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:30.709
tunnel. And I appreciate the

01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:32.812
explanation about how this
tunnel works because I thought

01:00:34.749 --> 01:00:37.250
it was just concrete all the way
through making this 30s. So

01:00:39.754 --> 01:00:41.755
that's very important
legislation. We're doing. All

01:00:43.358 --> 01:00:45.358
right. I'm generally in

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.359
alignment that I'm not really an

01:00:49.129 --> 01:00:51.129
expert on that. And I did hear a

01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:53.765
mention about director yekusiel.

01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:56.203
I said it right. I can't say I
ever really met director

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.340
yekusiel, but I wish very well.

01:01:00.608 --> 01:01:02.608
I really do. And maybe, maybe,

01:01:03.344 --> 01:01:05.612
perhaps, maybe I will meet up in
new york city subway. True. Your

01:01:12.754 --> 01:01:14.754
time is up next. Speaker.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:19.125
Herbert weiner, director tumlin

01:01:19.127 --> 01:01:21.127
pointed out the importance of

01:01:21.729 --> 01:01:23.729
small businesses to the economy

01:01:24.399 --> 01:01:26.399
and thriving of san francisco.

01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:28.734
Now it should be noted with the

01:01:29.905 --> 01:01:31.905
institute of corridors on

01:01:31.974 --> 01:01:33.974
mission street, taraval street

01:01:35.244 --> 01:01:37.244
and now gary street, small

01:01:37.412 --> 01:01:39.412
businesses have folded. And what

01:01:40.382 --> 01:01:42.350
is going to be done about the
restitution of these small

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.620
businesses? The projects

01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:48.789
resulted in diminishing revenue

01:01:49.725 --> 01:01:51.725
and too many businesses, small

01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:53.961
businesses had to give up shop.

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.130
So my concern is the restitution

01:01:57.332 --> 01:01:59.332
of small businesses and the

01:01:59.902 --> 01:02:01.902
advocacy of it in the light of

01:02:03.172 --> 01:02:05.172
mta projects which were actually

01:02:05.274 --> 01:02:07.274
detrimental to them. Thank you.

01:02:12.949 --> 01:02:15.490
Thank you. Next speaker. Hello
good afternoon. This is barry

01:02:19.121 --> 01:02:21.121
toronto. I want to wish director

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:25.794
yekutiel hallelujah to him after
what he witnessed in the last

01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:30.831
week or so. I would blame him

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.900
for changing his priorities and

01:02:33.669 --> 01:02:35.669
for stepping down. But I want to

01:02:36.205 --> 01:02:39.141
thank him for his help with
working with small businesses,

01:02:40.177 --> 01:02:42.811
including taxis. The problem is
we can't get enforcement at taxi

01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:46.715
stands and we are small
businesses providing a service

01:02:47.884 --> 01:02:50.719
for people to go and frequent
small businesses in different

01:02:51.854 --> 01:02:53.854
areas as well. But but we can't

01:02:55.159 --> 01:02:56.859
get enforcement at the cab
stands in these in these small

01:02:57.761 --> 01:02:59.761
business areas, such as 24th and

01:02:59.997 --> 01:03:02.598
mission, which brings about the
bill about harassment of female

01:03:03.634 --> 01:03:05.634
pco's while they're giving

01:03:05.669 --> 01:03:07.669
tickets over there. So it'd be

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.938
great if they were protected
while they're giving tickets at

01:03:10.973 --> 01:03:13.243
the cab stand at 24th and
mission. But we can't get any

01:03:13.344 --> 01:03:15.344
help. We can't get any

01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:19.820
enforcement. So and the next
thing about getting

01:03:21.985 --> 01:03:23.985
congratulations on. Ab 645 the

01:03:25.422 --> 01:03:27.422
only problem is what do we do

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.910
about the errant scooter riders

01:03:30.228 --> 01:03:32.228
who run red lights and speed

01:03:34.331 --> 01:03:36.331
through crosswalks and also

01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:38.333
pedestrians who take risks and

01:03:40.104 --> 01:03:42.105
walk while the light is green in
the opposing direction at

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:46.708
intersections, the for the word

01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:51.814
is no longer a good word of

01:03:52.316 --> 01:03:55.152
jaywalking. But you taking your
life in your own hands when you

01:03:55.786 --> 01:03:58.522
are crossing the street, when
you have the red light at the

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.570
pedestrian. So I think at the

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.590
same time, while promoting this

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:07.430
speed camera program, you're

01:04:07.832 --> 01:04:09.832
also promoting that pedestrians

01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:13.870
also observe the walk signals.
Thank you very much for your

01:04:15.573 --> 01:04:18.408
time. And I'm surprised you
didn't mention anything about

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.710
jaime parks and tom maguire.

01:04:23.215 --> 01:04:25.316
Thank you. Callers. Okay that
will close public comment.

01:04:28.408 --> 01:04:29.663
Please call the next item lisa
is you on item number eight, the

01:04:31.289 --> 01:04:33.289
citizens advisory council report

01:04:34.526 --> 01:04:37.427
. Good afternoon, directors.
It's a pleasure to address you

01:04:38.863 --> 01:04:40.863
today. Director yukkuri will

01:04:41.267 --> 01:04:43.234
allow me to, on behalf of the
cac, thank you for your service.

01:04:43.935 --> 01:04:45.970
We're sorry you're leaving the
board, but we've always

01:04:45.971 --> 01:04:48.306
appreciated your passion for
small businesses, us, and

01:04:48.373 --> 01:04:50.441
especially for the riders of san
francisco and especially

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:54.378
district eight. So thank you. We
had three presentations at our

01:04:56.348 --> 01:04:59.184
last meeting. It was a long one.
The first one was on the 2024

01:04:59.986 --> 01:05:01.986
legislative program and our

01:05:02.254 --> 01:05:04.254
motion was as follows. The sf

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.250
mta cac recommends that the
sfmta board adopt the 2024

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.995
legislative program priorities
as presented. I'm assuming they

01:05:12.397 --> 01:05:14.397
are coming to you soon and so

01:05:14.467 --> 01:05:16.535
you'll see the same
presentation. We saw something

01:05:18.571 --> 01:05:20.571
similar next. We had a very long

01:05:20.606 --> 01:05:22.606
presentation on the valencia

01:05:24.477 --> 01:05:26.477
bikeway pilot, which has been

01:05:26.512 --> 01:05:29.247
rather I know you've received a
lot of feedback about it. We've

01:05:29.882 --> 01:05:32.851
received a lot of feedback about
it. Not much of if any of it

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.620
positive. And our recommendation

01:05:36.122 --> 01:05:38.122
is as follows the sfmta cac

01:05:38.224 --> 01:05:40.158
recommends abandoning the
current unintuitive and

01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:43.610
dangerous center running bicycle
lane pilot on valencia and

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:46.731
refocusing the street toward its
core needs commercial

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
deliveries. Bicyclists outdoor

01:05:50.103 --> 01:05:52.771
diners and pedestrians by
pursuing a road geometry that

01:05:53.874 --> 01:05:55.874
disincentivizes nonresidential

01:05:57.711 --> 01:05:59.845
traffic. And finally, we also
heard a very interesting

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:01.912
presenter session on autonomous

01:06:02.849 --> 01:06:04.750
vehicles, which everyone is very
interested in as of late. And

01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:07.952
our recommendation is as follows

01:06:10.123 --> 01:06:12.123
the sfmta cac endorses the sfmta

01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:14.460
sfcta and sf planning
commission's request for a

01:06:14.628 --> 01:06:17.563
rehearing of the california
public utilities commission

01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:22.401
AUGUST 10th, 2023. Approval of
unlimited numbers of cruise and

01:06:23.369 --> 01:06:25.369
waymo vehicles charging for

01:06:26.173 --> 01:06:28.241
passenger rides 24 over seven in
all neighborhoods of the city

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:30.542
without doubt, an environmental

01:06:31.645 --> 01:06:33.746
impact report. Again, we I think
like staff, we think there

01:06:35.415 --> 01:06:36.949
should be a greater level of
transparency on autonomous

01:06:39.619 --> 01:06:41.854
vehicles and how they're working
or not working in san francisco

01:06:42.657 --> 01:06:44.657
streets for to the benefit of

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.792
everyone. Thank you all for your

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:50.295
time. Colleagues, do you have

01:06:50.931 --> 01:06:52.931
questions for chair lee for. I

01:06:54.368 --> 01:06:56.350
did, if you wouldn't mind.
Please go ahead. Director hinsey

01:07:00.675 --> 01:07:02.675
yeah. Um, I. Jennifer, thank you

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.545
for your engagement. For those
of us who missed the meeting, we

01:07:06.681 --> 01:07:08.681
know about your recommendation

01:07:08.716 --> 01:07:10.716
for valencia, but if you could

01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:14.220
provide a little bit more color
as to maybe some of the reasons

01:07:17.192 --> 01:07:20.270
why your members might, might
have landed on the

01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:24.465
recommendation that you did,
that would be I'd be interested

01:07:25.466 --> 01:07:28.435
in know just a little bit about
tenor, that discussion. Sure,

01:07:31.772 --> 01:07:33.772
sure. For the motion was not

01:07:33.909 --> 01:07:35.909
unanimously passed. And I think

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:39.547
some people on the council were
very concerned and we heard

01:07:39.948 --> 01:07:41.948
feedback from small businesses

01:07:42.485 --> 01:07:44.485
that are very concerned about

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.686
having access to being able to

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.689
park and for their employees. As

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:52.625
we heard from a local bar owner

01:07:53.128 --> 01:07:55.128
who is in danger of losing her

01:07:55.264 --> 01:07:56.964
business that she's had for
many, many years. I think some

01:07:57.833 --> 01:08:00.801
of us were swayed by that. And
also, again, we've heard

01:08:01.736 --> 01:08:03.736
consistent feedback from

01:08:04.473 --> 01:08:06.473
cyclists that the middle bikeway

01:08:07.175 --> 01:08:09.175
is unsafe. They don't like it,

01:08:09.278 --> 01:08:12.800
they don't want to use it, and
they either want to move to a

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.884
geometry that has a protected
bike lane on the outside of the

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:18.819
street rather than in the center
of the street, which would

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.856
require I mean, it's valencia is
not a big street. It's small.

01:08:22.657 --> 01:08:25.527
And something's going to have to
give. And I think the thing that

01:08:25.927 --> 01:08:28.463
people think might have to give
would be through traffic, which

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.980
could probably be routed onto

01:08:31.267 --> 01:08:33.935
guerrero, which has a lot of
traffic on it or mission, which

01:08:35.438 --> 01:08:37.438
has traffic on it as well. Um

01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:40.975
thank you for the thank you for
that additional information.

01:08:45.315 --> 01:08:48.160
Very helpful. Sure. My pleasure.
Ucucha. What do you mean? Get

01:08:49.118 --> 01:08:51.920
rid of through traffic? I'm
sorry. What traffic does? What

01:08:52.655 --> 01:08:54.789
does that mean? Exactly? What
traffic I didn't getting rid of

01:08:55.691 --> 01:08:57.691
through traffic. Like cars that

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.629
are just driving down valencia
like a non resident because

01:09:00.629 --> 01:09:03.165
there are residences on
valencia. So residents would

01:09:04.434 --> 01:09:06.568
want to have access to the
street but not like people just

01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:10.806
driving down valencia. So the
idea would be to have it be

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:13.609
restricted to like folks that
live on valencia would be the

01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:16.678
only ones that could drive on
it. Hypothetically. Yes I think

01:09:18.314 --> 01:09:20.483
that's kind of what they were
what we were leaning towards.

01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.888
Okay, thanks. Sure thank you. I
also had sort of some follow up

01:09:25.889 --> 01:09:27.889
questions specifically on this

01:09:28.258 --> 01:09:30.326
last phrase, which is by
pursuing a road geometry that

01:09:31.594 --> 01:09:33.594
disincentivizes non residential

01:09:33.596 --> 01:09:35.596
traffic. Just wondering if you

01:09:35.865 --> 01:09:37.867
could bring us in on your
thinking. Were there are certain

01:09:37.901 --> 01:09:40.671
like scenarios you had talked
about or what led the commission

01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:42.671
to make this decision? Again, I

01:09:43.307 --> 01:09:46.750
think those who supported the
motion were really wanting

01:09:47.311 --> 01:09:49.311
something more where valencia is

01:09:50.247 --> 01:09:53.820
more pedestrianized and I think
that's kind of where they were.

01:09:53.216 --> 01:09:55.987
I think that's where they were
trending. And it was it was

01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:58.922
compromised language that we
worked out to try and get them

01:09:59.857 --> 01:10:02.910
to get the motion passed because
I think some folks wanted pretty

01:10:03.627 --> 01:10:05.627
much no cars at all. Other folks

01:10:06.764 --> 01:10:09.650
wanted cars. So we could have so
it would be much more aggressive

01:10:09.967 --> 01:10:12.502
to say for businesses and things
like that. But I think this was

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.639
sort of the compromise that was
reached. I don't know if that

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.541
fully answers your question. No,
it's helpful. That's helpful.

01:10:19.577 --> 01:10:21.811
DR. Tumlin, can you remind us
when the update is coming on

01:10:23.314 --> 01:10:25.314
valencia street? We talked

01:10:25.616 --> 01:10:27.616
about, I think DECEMBER when we

01:10:28.218 --> 01:10:30.218
adopted it. I see sitting in the

01:10:33.391 --> 01:10:35.592
back livable streets lead. Jamie
parks as well as soon to be

01:10:35.793 --> 01:10:38.280
acting livable streets lead.
Kimberly leong, who's the

01:10:38.295 --> 01:10:40.295
currently the project manager

01:10:42.299 --> 01:10:44.299
for valencia yeah. Sorry hop on

01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:48.339
in. Hi kimberly liang, the
project manager for the valencia

01:10:48.807 --> 01:10:50.807
bikeway project. We plan to

01:10:51.409 --> 01:10:53.344
return as soon as JANUARY 2024.
We're in the process of

01:10:53.411 --> 01:10:55.411
collecting data right now for

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:58.548
the project, and we've asked her

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.684
to come back so we can give you
a recommendation on on the pilot

01:11:01.119 --> 01:11:03.119
extension, because I think

01:11:03.454 --> 01:11:05.556
you're looking whether or not to
extend the pilot in JANUARY.

01:11:06.191 --> 01:11:08.580
Right so in JANUARY. When we
return, we'll have information

01:11:08.259 --> 01:11:11.162
from our three month evaluation
mark. And as a part of that,

01:11:11.196 --> 01:11:13.196
we'll have any recommendations

01:11:13.765 --> 01:11:16.400
for where we should head next
with this pilot, whether it be

01:11:16.601 --> 01:11:18.802
improvements or adjustments that
need to be made. Okay. Thank

01:11:19.604 --> 01:11:21.538
you. Yeah. It's our intention to
give you a recommendation as

01:11:22.308 --> 01:11:24.542
well. Once we hear the data.
Okay thank you for your report

01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:27.711
and for your service. Oh, sorry.

01:11:27.813 --> 01:11:29.813
I didn't see you. Yes, director.

01:11:32.818 --> 01:11:35.553
So go ahead. Oh, sorry. Sorry
I'm always a little today. I'm a

01:11:36.821 --> 01:11:38.821
little bit lag of my, my

01:11:39.826 --> 01:11:41.726
response was delayed, so I
apologize. Thank you, chair.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.620
Thank you for sharing. All your

01:11:46.532 --> 01:11:48.532
input is very, very insightful

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.340
and really liked it. And I keep

01:11:51.804 --> 01:11:53.804
thinking I actually live in the

01:11:54.606 --> 01:11:56.606
mission and I've seen the

01:11:56.943 --> 01:11:58.943
evolution of what's happening in

01:12:01.848 --> 01:12:03.848
valencia and yeah, we need to

01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:06.685
continue to refine this. And I
like most part of your

01:12:07.787 --> 01:12:09.954
recommendations and I just keep
thinking your last sentences,

01:12:12.491 --> 01:12:14.559
which our chair had brought up,
if you can elaborate. And I

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:18.930
thought of this morning, I spent

01:12:19.499 --> 01:12:21.499
my whole morning holding hands

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:23.834
with one of my really senior

01:12:26.906 --> 01:12:28.906
mentor just to walk ten steps up

01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:32.643
to the alamo square park. And I

01:12:33.647 --> 01:12:35.781
know that I have a lot of my
mentors that are actually we

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.917
enjoy time to go to nice

01:12:38.952 --> 01:12:40.952
restaurant. And so spend like a

01:12:42.555 --> 01:12:44.555
morning and lunch or dinner. So

01:12:45.225 --> 01:12:47.225
if we can you explain to me your

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560
recommendation. So how am I

01:12:49.563 --> 01:12:51.563
going to get my mentor to

01:12:52.132 --> 01:12:54.132
actually enjoy these restaurants

01:12:54.234 --> 01:12:56.234
on valencia if she can actually

01:12:57.371 --> 01:13:00.139
walk really just just five steps
or ten steps? I'm just looking

01:13:01.341 --> 01:13:03.341
at people who actually can't

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:07.847
bike, can row. Right. And they
are relying on paratransit or

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:11.651
their loved ones if they're
lucky and fortunate enough to

01:13:13.287 --> 01:13:15.655
have the resource, to have their
loved ones actually drive them,

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.957
to get them to where they can go

01:13:19.259 --> 01:13:21.861
to, to have their normal social
life or sometimes simply some

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.430
efficacy of community work. So I

01:13:26.334 --> 01:13:29.136
just wanted to see if you your,
your your group had thought

01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:35.109
about the equity component of
that was that yeah, we did get a

01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:37.911
comment. A public comment like
that. And personally I think

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:41.140
that's a very insightful comment
and something that needs to be

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:43.416
considered as we again try to

01:13:45.498 --> 01:13:46.739
figure out all of the competing
priorities for that very slim

01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:50.289
street. But yeah, some people, a

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:52.859
car is the only option really,
especially if we're not running

01:13:53.661 --> 01:13:56.229
transit down valencia anymore,
which we aren't. It's and it's

01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:58.997
not really fair to say, well

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.735
it's only a block away and,
well, a block can be a mile for

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.671
some people. Exactly I think

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.208
that's a very good point. Okay.
Would you would is a good point.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.145
Would you would you refine your
recommendation or maybe bring it

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.782
back into to us to see what you.
I think that's something we'll

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.518
need to consider once we get the

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.721
data and we come back with a
recommendation in JANUARY. That

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.357
would be great. Thank you. Thank
you. Director hensley has a

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.893
question for you as well. Sure I

01:14:26.961 --> 01:14:28.961
do. Sorry, charlie, for to put

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.632
you on the hot seat today. But

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400
you did you did mention that you

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.971
intend to come back to us with a

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:43.440
recommendation. So I'm trying to
figure out what your recommend

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.482
for us today is or should we be
should we be holding off

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:51.351
basically until you come back

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:54.220
with your. I think the
recommendation in JANUARY. Yeah,

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.257
that's a good no, that's a good

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.327
point. I think the thrust of the
council's recommendation today

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.763
is moving away from the center
bike lane. I think that's the

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
real that's the meat of it. And

01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:09.370
then but you're still going to
wait until the project is

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:13.307
evaluated to come and write

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:15.743
another recommendation. Yes I
think we felt that since staff

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.513
was going to issue a
recommendation to you in JANUARY

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.681
, we thought we would chime in

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.852
as well. Okay got it. Okay.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.554
Thank you for your service. You

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:32.293
bet. Let's open public comment

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:35.797
on the cac report items, please,

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.380
for those in the room. Thank you

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:54.516
. Thank you. Hi. Board members.
Luke bornheimer, I urge you to

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:57.219
take the cac unprecedented
mmendation and direct staff

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.621
to immediately replace this
valencia street center bikeway

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.859
with either curbside protected
bike lanes or pedestrianization

01:16:03.961 --> 01:16:06.495
of the street, which can include
access for commercial

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:09.564
deliveries. Local residents and

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:12.535
people with disabilities. As
more people are crashing or

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.971
being hit, killed or injured on
valencia with the center bikeway

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.273
and significantly more than the
portion of valencia where

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.778
curbside protected bike lanes
were installed in 2019 and

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:25.146
multiple evaluation by sfmta

01:16:25.716 --> 01:16:28.151
staff showed that cars parked in
the bike lane decrease their 99.

01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:31.219
Close calls decreased to 100,

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.240
and the number of people biking
increased 49. Curbside protected

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:37.828
bike lanes work phenomenally
well. Improved safety for all

01:16:38.396 --> 01:16:41.364
people, including drivers, and
increase revenue for local

01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:44.433
businesses and they can be

01:16:46.403 --> 01:16:49.138
installed on valencia using
quick build materials in months,

01:16:50.107 --> 01:16:52.107
if not weeks in an email, sfmta

01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:54.778
staff told me they didn't create
a design for curbside protected

01:16:55.546 --> 01:16:58.215
bike lanes because the design
wouldn't allow for car parking

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160
on both sides of the street.

01:17:01.252 --> 01:17:03.487
Only 56 days after the center
bikeway pilot was officially

01:17:04.555 --> 01:17:06.923
started, an 80 year old man was
killed on valencia. Countless

01:17:07.592 --> 01:17:09.826
other people have crashed or
been injured as a result of the

01:17:11.163 --> 01:17:13.731
center bikeway and even more
have had close calls which could
have resulted in them being

01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:17.000
killed or seriously injured,
including a mom with a kid on

01:17:17.769 --> 01:17:19.769
her bike. About a week ago, the

01:17:19.871 --> 01:17:22.473
people of san francisco and our
planet need you to take

01:17:22.473 --> 01:17:25.342
immediate action to make
valencia safer for people,
better for business and

01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.410
effective for fighting climate

01:17:28.614 --> 01:17:31.480
change. I urge you to take the
unprecedented recommendation in

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.551
and direct staff to immediately
replace the valencia street

01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:36.487
center, bikeway with either
curbside protected bike lanes or

01:17:36.488 --> 01:17:39.356
pedestrianization of the street,
which can include access for

01:17:39.557 --> 01:17:41.492
commercial deliveries, local
residents and people with

01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:44.728
disabilities. As you are the
only people who can help us and

01:17:45.697 --> 01:17:48.333
we need you to take immediate
action to protect us, our

01:17:49.267 --> 01:17:52.360
businesses and the planet. Thank
you. Thank you. Next speaker,

01:17:58.677 --> 01:18:00.778
please. Hi, stacy randecker. I
could talk all day about

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.583
valencia, but I did want to say
to director so, so I agree with

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:06.885
everything that luke said,
although I'm all for

01:18:07.253 --> 01:18:09.954
pedestrianization for as much of
the corridor that it makes sense

01:18:10.856 --> 01:18:13.124
at this time. I think at the
lower end and the protected bike

01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:15.826
lanes are working fine and it
doesn't have quite the vibe that

01:18:17.362 --> 01:18:19.897
the center of, of valencia does.
As for your mentor and friend, I

01:18:22.268 --> 01:18:24.268
totally understand my dad who

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.338
recently passed, he was he
couldn't walk either. It would

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.742
have been an issue for him. But
what I would say is what do you

01:18:30.943 --> 01:18:33.645
do when you take them to the
airport? What do you do when you

01:18:34.647 --> 01:18:36.647
take them to the mall? That's

01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:39.217
the same thing that we would ask
to be done for valencia. We do

01:18:39.319 --> 01:18:41.620
not want to limit accessibility
to anyone when we're talking

01:18:41.621 --> 01:18:44.220
about pedestrianization, but we
have to change our mind about

01:18:45.158 --> 01:18:47.893
what accessibility really means.
As I was out on valencia, I've

01:18:47.994 --> 01:18:50.795
been out there the last three
saturday nights all night that

01:18:51.631 --> 01:18:53.631
it's closed and the things that

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.869
I've seen the people in the
mobility scooters, the dad with

01:18:59.673 --> 01:19:01.673
the teen daughter with a like a

01:19:01.908 --> 01:19:03.908
glider sort of apparatus,

01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:06.445
there's it's so wide. There's
nowhere else you can go. You

01:19:06.846 --> 01:19:08.981
could never do that on a
sidewalk. You could only do that

01:19:10.549 --> 01:19:12.551
on like jfk. Great highway when
it's closed or a place like

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.588
valencia, I don't know where
they live. I was too know I

01:19:15.789 --> 01:19:17.789
didn't want to go bother them,

01:19:18.392 --> 01:19:21.193
but it just was like where does
she have to go? Like this to see

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:23.662
the little kids out on their
strider bikes and stuff? We

01:19:24.364 --> 01:19:27.166
don't have that on our side of
town. We need spaces like this.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.935
It does so much for the
merchants. And if it's not

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:32.705
working, then we have to figure
out how to make it work. Our

01:19:33.607 --> 01:19:35.607
city and our planet, the people

01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:39.450
who live here, we need it to be
more livable. We need it to be a

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.880
place where people can go and

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:44.449
want to go. And there it's full

01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:47.452
of life. Not just cars. We can

01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:51.358
do this. We need as an agency,
as the city. We need to start

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.940
saying how can we do it
differently? Not like what is

01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:57.797
the problem? What is the one off
case? How do we solve for as

01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:01.134
much as possible? That's what we
need to move forward. Thank you.

01:20:03.203 --> 01:20:05.203
Thank you. Any other speakers in

01:20:06.407 --> 01:20:09.242
the room for item eight? Seeing
none, please open the phone at

01:20:10.178 --> 01:20:12.212
this time we'll move to remote
public comment, not to exceed a

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:14.781
total time of ten minutes.
Members of the public wishing to

01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:17.684
comment on item number eight
should dial star three to enter

01:20:18.585 --> 01:20:20.220
the queue. Each speaker will
have two minutes. Moderator for

01:20:25.193 --> 01:20:27.861
speaker. Hello. Good afternoon
again and sorry toronto. As you

01:20:29.964 --> 01:20:31.964
know, valencia street already is

01:20:32.433 --> 01:20:35.102
traffic calming because you you
have to stop in every every

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:39.339
light down valencia street
unless you're going really slow.

01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:45.146
So it's already not lights are
not timed. The only problem is

01:20:45.346 --> 01:20:47.346
you can't get off of valencia

01:20:47.449 --> 01:20:49.449
street because you can't make

01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:52.251
any left turns in that area. So

01:20:54.188 --> 01:20:56.188
the center. So I applaud the for

01:20:56.691 --> 01:20:58.691
wanting to abandon in this

01:21:00.496 --> 01:21:03.464
failed experiment of the center
running bike lane. I also want

01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:09.690
to applaud the cac for endorsing
the rehearing request by the

01:21:09.938 --> 01:21:11.938
city attorney and the city

01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:16.510
departments just the other night
at bill graham civic auditorium,

01:21:18.146 --> 01:21:20.146
there was a rave like event

01:21:20.983 --> 01:21:22.983
going on at and one of the

01:21:24.286 --> 01:21:27.155
autonomous vehicles ran into the
barrier blocking grove street

01:21:27.989 --> 01:21:29.989
between larkin and paul. It does

01:21:31.626 --> 01:21:34.563
not recognize these items that
close streets off temporarily.

01:21:36.666 --> 01:21:39.135
So there has it has to go back
to the drawing board to deal

01:21:39.135 --> 01:21:41.135
with these. Unlike unlikely

01:21:42.438 --> 01:21:44.438
situations that their autonomous

01:21:44.506 --> 01:21:46.707
vehicles can't figure out. Thank
you very much for your time.

01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:54.917
Thank you. Next speaker.
Afternoon, directors. This is

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:57.919
cyrus hall. I'm calling as a
bike rider who rides in valencia

01:21:59.622 --> 01:22:01.622
sometimes I'm frustrated to hear

01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:04.426
that agency will not be bringing
an update until JANUARY on the

01:22:05.427 --> 01:22:07.427
valencia bike lane. The number

01:22:07.863 --> 01:22:09.863
of issues that have been

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.100
reported. We've had a death.
We've had a number of injuries.

01:22:14.838 --> 01:22:17.500
Is calls for more urgency on
this issue than waiting until

01:22:18.575 --> 01:22:20.409
JANUARY. I want to give a couple
examples. When you're writing

01:22:20.777 --> 01:22:23.678
down the center bike lane and
sfpd decides that they don't

01:22:26.771 --> 01:22:29.185
decide they have an emergency
and they're using the center
lane to get to where they're
going as quickly as possible.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.988
You as a writer have nowhere to
go. You do. You have to bet that

01:22:34.591 --> 01:22:36.591
other traffic is going to behave

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.461
perfectly and cautiously as you
try to escape the oncoming

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.200
vehicle while in the lane. I
don't know how this wasn't

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:47.170
thought about when this was when
this was designed. The bike turn

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.700
boxes are death traps. No one

01:22:52.409 --> 01:22:54.977
wants to use them. No one wants
to be in those boxes because it

01:22:55.245 --> 01:22:57.246
requires drivers to behave
perfectly and drivers don't

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.620
behave perfect. I urge a faster
sped up analysis of the

01:23:04.622 --> 01:23:07.257
incidents the agency is aware of
and quicker action on this issue

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.860
. Thank you very much. Thank you

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.630
. No additional speakers. I'll
close public comment. I see

01:23:17.636 --> 01:23:19.636
director hemminger has a comment

01:23:20.638 --> 01:23:22.638
. Thank you, MADAM Chair. And I

01:23:22.907 --> 01:23:24.907
apologize for not raising this

01:23:27.745 --> 01:23:29.745
earlier. You know, I fear that

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:32.381
we're headed toward another show

01:23:34.985 --> 01:23:37.221
on valencia in JANUARY. If all
we're going to be talking about

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.558
is the results of the pilot with
the center running lane. I

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:45.595
believe I made the point when we
originally considered this item

01:23:46.197 --> 01:23:48.197
that we really only had one

01:23:48.332 --> 01:23:50.332
option in front of us and that

01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:55.172
it was worthwhile doing being a
pilot and doing an evaluation

01:23:56.808 --> 01:23:58.808
session. But it sort of compared

01:24:00.245 --> 01:24:02.579
to what an and one thing that's
clearly been mentioned is a more

01:24:05.883 --> 01:24:08.510
traditional protected bike lane
on the outside, which obviously

01:24:08.552 --> 01:24:10.552
is going to interfere with

01:24:11.857 --> 01:24:13.857
parking given the geometry of

01:24:14.293 --> 01:24:16.961
the road. And the other one is
what we've done on market, which

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.633
is to eliminate private vehicles
, which comes with its own set

01:24:25.637 --> 01:24:27.637
of trouble, but it strikes me

01:24:28.473 --> 01:24:30.375
that if we only have one option
in front of us again, we're

01:24:32.144 --> 01:24:34.912
liable to get the same result,
which is a room full of unhappy

01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:40.150
people on each side, determined
that they've got the point of

01:24:40.986 --> 01:24:43.320
view. I mean, some of the
testimony now is getting a

01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:47.558
little bit ideological and I

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560
thought one of our purposes was

01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.195
to try to turn down the
temperature a little bit. So,

01:24:53.199 --> 01:24:55.100
jeff, maybe you could just give
us a sense of your expectation

01:24:58.604 --> 01:25:00.604
of how much work we can do to by

01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:04.407
JANUARY or if it's a month or so

01:25:06.179 --> 01:25:09.470
later, whatever, in having 2 or
3 legitimate options on the

01:25:10.116 --> 01:25:12.784
table instead of just one with a
bunch of people shooting yes and

01:25:15.954 --> 01:25:17.954
no at it. So excuse me, chair,

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.625
MAY I interrupt? Deputy city
attorney susan cleveland-knowles

01:25:21.494 --> 01:25:24.297
I did just want to remind the
board that the item that was

01:25:24.297 --> 01:25:26.297
agendized today was a report

01:25:27.467 --> 01:25:29.467
from the cac and that the

01:25:29.569 --> 01:25:31.569
broader topic of valencia is not

01:25:33.306 --> 01:25:36.740
on the agenda today. So think if
jeff wants to give a brief

01:25:36.943 --> 01:25:38.943
response, I think that's fine.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.120
But we should probably in their

01:25:41.114 --> 01:25:43.114
report was this item, right?

01:25:44.184 --> 01:25:46.185
Yeah right. But this is you've
asked questions and sought

01:25:46.786 --> 01:25:48.786
clarification from the cac about

01:25:49.122 --> 01:25:51.122
their resolution on which was

01:25:52.558 --> 01:25:54.558
the identified object. Not a

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560
full not a full discussion of

01:25:57.664 --> 01:26:00.320
valencia. And so I would just
urge some caution. I mean, I

01:26:01.535 --> 01:26:03.535
think we can respond to director

01:26:04.271 --> 01:26:06.271
hemings's question, but but it's

01:26:08.542 --> 01:26:11.176
just really about what the cac
reported to you, what I am

01:26:12.278 --> 01:26:14.278
hearing is direction from

01:26:14.348 --> 01:26:16.583
director hemminger that when we
come back to you in JANUARY,

01:26:17.952 --> 01:26:19.952
that we evaluate an array of

01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:24.890
options. Yeah. In short, that's

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.960
it. So if you're going to do
that, I'm happy and I hope our

01:26:29.596 --> 01:26:31.798
council is happy to. Yeah, I'm
no issues. Sorry, I didn't know

01:26:32.733 --> 01:26:34.733
how long the discussion was

01:26:35.603 --> 01:26:38.505
going to go on. Thank you. Okay
thank you. Let's please call the

01:26:39.907 --> 01:26:41.907
next item. Next item. Very good.

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.440
Item number nine. General public
comment. Members of the public

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440
MAY address the board of

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:48.381
directors on matters that are
within the board's jurisdiction,

01:26:49.684 --> 01:26:51.952
but not on today's calendar
hour. I do have a speaker card

01:26:56.991 --> 01:26:59.125
for stacy randecker. Okay go
ahead. Hi, my name is rex

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.762
ridgeway. I'm the PRESIDENT Of
the ptsa at lincoln high school.

01:27:05.734 --> 01:27:07.734
And I'm here to talk about a

01:27:08.103 --> 01:27:10.871
situation with the number 48
bus. This is a condensed

01:27:11.806 --> 01:27:14.641
timeline of correspondence from
our assistant principal to a

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.980
person who works at the here. I

01:27:21.215 --> 01:27:23.216
won't name the name, but I'll
just give you the date.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.620
SEPTEMBER 20th, 26. The 40. The

01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:29.122
number 48. Number 8657 stopped

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:31.992
by this school, did not open the
doors and drove off without

01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:35.695
picking up anybody. SEPTEMBER

01:27:35.997 --> 01:27:37.997
27th. Thank you for your time

01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:42.470
with us. The 48 number 8847 was
listed as not in service and

01:27:45.874 --> 01:27:47.874
just drove by by OCTOBER second

01:27:49.244 --> 01:27:51.244
48. Number three, 48 busses on

01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:54.281
friday after school drove by our
kids and did not pick them up.

01:27:54.816 --> 01:27:56.816
The bus numbers were eight,

01:27:59.221 --> 01:28:01.221
eight, 98812 and 8888. OCTOBER

01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:04.191
3rd two weeks ago. Our assistant

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:06.493
principal emailed this

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.297
individual and said, I know that
you are investigating. Do you

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.999
have any follow up? Our
community is wondering if

01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:14.501
there's any improvement since

01:28:15.405 --> 01:28:17.405
you notified us. And to my

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.874
knowledge as of this morning,
two weeks have passed and we

01:28:20.643 --> 01:28:22.643
don't know what's going on. So

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:24.813
I'm here because I have time and
I would like to. And the

01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:27.715
assistant principal called me
and said, rex, can you do

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.386
something? I said, I'll make a
public comment. Thank you. So,

01:28:31.687 --> 01:28:34.156
sir, the board can't address
your item, but al ramos, who's

01:28:35.225 --> 01:28:37.759
in the audience, can direct you
to the right folks in our

01:28:38.761 --> 01:28:40.761
transit division. Okay. Thank

01:28:41.264 --> 01:28:43.264
you so much. Thank you for your

01:28:54.778 --> 01:28:56.779
comment. Next speaker, please.
Hi. Board members. Luke

01:28:57.714 --> 01:28:59.848
bornheimer. I urge you to
immediatove a citywide

01:29:00.917 --> 01:29:03.685
no turn on red policy and direct
staff to create a plan for

01:29:03.786 --> 01:29:06.688
implementing that policy as soon
as possible to make it safer,

01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:09.325
easier and more comfortable for
people to cross our streets and

01:29:09.393 --> 01:29:11.494
increase safety for all people,
especially for children, seniors

01:29:12.462 --> 01:29:14.462
and people with disabilities, as

01:29:14.464 --> 01:29:16.464
well as people who walk, bike

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.680
and even drivers during your
meeting two weeks ago, the board

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:21.436
of supervisors unanimously
approved supervisor preston's

01:29:22.305 --> 01:29:24.305
resolution urging you to approve

01:29:24.307 --> 01:29:26.943
a citywide no turn on red policy
on the resolution's first

01:29:27.578 --> 01:29:30.313
reading of a remarkable event
for the board of supervisors and

01:29:31.415 --> 01:29:34.116
a historic moment for our city.
Since the board of supervisors

01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:37.920
unanimous approval urging you to
approve a citywide policy. More

01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:40.210
than 15 news outlets have

01:29:40.424 --> 01:29:42.525
covered the public campaign I
started that's support voters

01:29:42.693 --> 01:29:44.693
have sent you and other policy

01:29:44.829 --> 01:29:46.829
makers more than 5000 emails in

01:29:47.365 --> 01:29:49.766
the san francisco chronicle and
los angeles times covered the

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:53.703
approval. And this morning, the
guardian covered it as well.

01:29:54.571 --> 01:29:56.571
This is an amazing opportunity

01:29:57.174 --> 01:29:59.175
for you and our city to lead on
a proven street safety

01:29:59.543 --> 01:30:01.378
improvement that will make our
streets instantly safer,

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.648
especially for children, seniors
and people with disabilities. As

01:30:04.849 --> 01:30:06.849
well as people who walk, bike

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:09.520
and drive. I urge you to
immediately approve a citywide

01:30:10.855 --> 01:30:13.456
no turn on red policy and direct
staff to create a plan for

01:30:14.258 --> 01:30:16.159
implementing that policy as soon
as possible to make it safer,

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.896
easier and more comfortable for
people to cross our streets and

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.199
increase safety for all people,
especially for children, seniors

01:30:23.434 --> 01:30:26.303
and people with disabilities, as
well as people who walk, bike

01:30:27.638 --> 01:30:30.273
and even drivers. For anyone who
supports a no turn on red,

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.645
please go to or rssf.Com. Thank
you. Thank you. Next speaker,

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.492
please. Hi stacy randecker again
. So you all probably know that

01:30:48.759 --> 01:30:50.759
we are in a global climate

01:30:51.496 --> 01:30:53.496
emergency and even though we

01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:55.499
hear do rarely suffer the ill

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.602
effects of severe weather, it is
not the case with the rest of

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.808
the world. Transportation is the
number one single contributor to

01:31:02.808 --> 01:31:04.808
climate change for san

01:31:04.976 --> 01:31:06.976
francisco, california and the

01:31:07.979 --> 01:31:10.470
united states. We need to change
absolute absolutely everything

01:31:13.219 --> 01:31:15.219
about how people and goods move

01:31:15.621 --> 01:31:17.621
at the same time, our streets

01:31:17.723 --> 01:31:19.723
have been particularly dangerous

01:31:19.825 --> 01:31:22.590
for those outside of car.
Instead of reaching vision zero,

01:31:24.996 --> 01:31:27.965
we're at zero vision making
effectively no impact in the
near decade since our

01:31:28.801 --> 01:31:31.436
supervisors initially resolved
that we would eliminate deaths

01:31:32.471 --> 01:31:34.471
from transportation trans base

01:31:36.564 --> 01:31:39.544
where sfmta gets its traffic
injury data has not been updated

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.412
since MARCH 31st. It has been

01:31:42.848 --> 01:31:44.848
without an owner since JULY 1st,

01:31:46.853 --> 01:31:48.853
so sfmta, or at least the public

01:31:49.555 --> 01:31:51.555
is flying blind. With regard to

01:31:52.758 --> 01:31:54.259
the state of our streets, i
realize that eliminating

01:31:55.294 --> 01:31:57.294
transportation and greenhouse

01:31:57.363 --> 01:31:59.363
gas emissions and traffic deaths

01:31:59.698 --> 01:32:01.698
seems like an impossibility. But

01:32:02.301 --> 01:32:04.301
we must. And they are absolutely

01:32:05.638 --> 01:32:08.407
intertwined. And I am echoing
what I have heard many of you

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:11.542
say that this agency needs to

01:32:11.577 --> 01:32:13.577
get creative about making

01:32:14.814 --> 01:32:17.249
change, change that our city and
our planet require year. Could

01:32:18.351 --> 01:32:20.351
we reinstitute the innovation

01:32:20.354 --> 01:32:23.289
position that sfmta once had
someone that is thinking about

01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:26.392
how to solve these very large
issues and bring forth a variety

01:32:26.693 --> 01:32:28.693
of solutions every time? Could

01:32:29.296 --> 01:32:30.863
we have someone that is
responsible for vision zero,

01:32:31.831 --> 01:32:33.831
someone that will ensure that

01:32:33.867 --> 01:32:36.735
the data is up to date available
to the public completely

01:32:37.738 --> 01:32:39.738
comprehensive and reports out

01:32:39.807 --> 01:32:41.807
changes to be or a thorough

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:44.709
analysis for keeping the status

01:32:45.546 --> 01:32:47.546
quo of our streets. Too often I

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.680
hear that. Oh, it's fine, no

01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:52.151
changes need to be made. That's
your time. Thank you. We need to

01:32:52.986 --> 01:32:54.986
make change. Thank you. Next

01:32:58.459 --> 01:33:00.459
speaker, please. I'll make this

01:33:02.362 --> 01:33:04.362
quick. My issue today in and

01:33:04.465 --> 01:33:06.465
quite frequently is parking

01:33:07.835 --> 01:33:09.835
tickets in the city. The number

01:33:09.937 --> 01:33:12.838
one thing that says I think that
we should make some changes is

01:33:14.542 --> 01:33:17.100
if you google what city has the
most expensive parking tickets?

01:33:17.745 --> 01:33:19.879
There's articles that come out.
It's always san francisco at the

01:33:21.682 --> 01:33:23.682
top. And we're a city that that

01:33:23.918 --> 01:33:25.918
prides herself on on on on

01:33:26.387 --> 01:33:28.387
change. And focusing on low

01:33:30.158 --> 01:33:32.158
income people. And I think it's

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.160
shameful that we have that and

01:33:35.763 --> 01:33:38.266
yeah it's very frustrating and I
and I understand you were

01:33:38.266 --> 01:33:41.168
talking earlier about the
administrative process for

01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:44.370
dismissing citations. I think

01:33:47.108 --> 01:33:49.977
that the reasons that you can
give or the reasons that that

01:33:50.378 --> 01:33:52.378
citation will be dismissed

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.380
administratively are kind of

01:33:56.884 --> 01:33:58.952
kept secret. And it's somewhat
of a convoluted process. And

01:34:00.388 --> 01:34:03.230
then you have to go to the
second level through the
kangaroo court. And the third

01:34:03.691 --> 01:34:06.560
one, you have to pay everything
and then pay more to go before a

01:34:07.329 --> 01:34:09.329
real judge. And I've done that

01:34:12.167 --> 01:34:14.167
and I won. Yay but it's a

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.300
struggle and it lasts months to

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:20.390
get to get a refund. I just

01:34:20.675 --> 01:34:22.675
think it's an issue that should

01:34:22.978 --> 01:34:24.679
be addressed. And I know you're
following the law, but I think

01:34:26.548 --> 01:34:29.840
the city can can go beyond that
and make it more more focused on

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.840
on the residents. Thank you.

01:34:32.754 --> 01:34:35.389
Thank you. No other speakers in
the room. Please open the remote

01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:38.590
public comment at this time.
We'll move to remote public

01:34:39.461 --> 01:34:41.596
comment not to exceed a total
time of ten minutes. Members of

01:34:41.898 --> 01:34:43.832
the public wishing to comment
should dial star three to enter

01:34:45.234 --> 01:34:46.801
the queue. Each speaker will
have two minutes. Moderator

01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:52.390
first speaker, thank you. Chair

01:34:52.308 --> 01:34:55.242
amanda alito. Dupree for the
record, she and her speak

01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:58.411
generally, I'm just an ordinary

01:35:00.216 --> 01:35:02.216
user of muni. Maybe I'm one of a

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.820
very rare few, but I am. I hope

01:35:06.155 --> 01:35:08.623
you hear me all right. And how
do we build the best muni? We

01:35:09.725 --> 01:35:11.725
can? I often learn things in

01:35:12.561 --> 01:35:14.561
other places. I read about a

01:35:15.231 --> 01:35:17.231
program in new jersey on nj

01:35:19.435 --> 01:35:22.271
transit called ride kinds and
saying hate has no place, hate

01:35:23.773 --> 01:35:25.773
has no seat on our system. Um, I

01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:28.210
would like to see us have that
kind of work here at muni

01:35:29.779 --> 01:35:31.779
because I want to feel fully

01:35:32.214 --> 01:35:35.118
included on muni and I feel very
fortunate that your senior staff

01:35:36.186 --> 01:35:38.186
has fully included me and

01:35:38.221 --> 01:35:40.221
welcomed me in the things that

01:35:40.623 --> 01:35:43.559
muni. But the leadership really
comes from you. So I've been

01:35:45.761 --> 01:35:47.761
away from you for a little

01:35:47.864 --> 01:35:49.864
while, but I did go to new york

01:35:51.302 --> 01:35:54.103
city and I did ride on their
legendary system called a subway

01:35:55.339 --> 01:35:57.339
. And every time I wrote it

01:35:59.109 --> 01:36:01.677
while wearing a skirt, nobody
tried to stop me from using the

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:05.481
system in new york. I don't
think anybody would do it on

01:36:06.516 --> 01:36:08.516
muni, but I ask that you not

01:36:08.619 --> 01:36:10.619
entertain any kind of hate on

01:36:11.222 --> 01:36:13.891
muni because I want to be able
to use the system fully and

01:36:13.891 --> 01:36:15.891
hopefully I'll use the

01:36:15.993 --> 01:36:17.993
autonomous vehicles which will

01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:22.532
offer me a safe skirt friendly
way for me to traverse the city.

01:36:26.671 --> 01:36:28.905
I'm just waiting for my 30s code
. Um. Some of you have not met

01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.420
me, but I hope to be meet you at

01:36:36.413 --> 01:36:39.349
a meeting in person soon along
with the senior staff that has

01:36:41.251 --> 01:36:43.251
always welcomed me fully on this

01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:46.923
system. Senior staff can can
only do so much because they

01:36:49.527 --> 01:36:51.527
work for you. Muni needs. The

01:36:51.929 --> 01:36:54.564
tone for muni needs to be set by
you and I ask that you build the

01:36:55.333 --> 01:36:58.167
most welcoming system we can. We
can learn from new jersey and

01:36:58.269 --> 01:37:00.269
new york. Thank you. Next

01:37:05.944 --> 01:37:07.944
speaker. Is herbert weiner. I

01:37:08.413 --> 01:37:10.413
wish to speak on the extension

01:37:11.849 --> 01:37:13.849
of parking hours. Now you've

01:37:15.686 --> 01:37:17.686
pointed out that, you know, you

01:37:17.889 --> 01:37:19.889
need extended parking hours for

01:37:20.592 --> 01:37:22.592
more revenue, but this could be

01:37:23.996 --> 01:37:25.996
greatly offset by the need to

01:37:27.499 --> 01:37:29.499
employ additional staff to

01:37:31.603 --> 01:37:34.538
enforce the parking hours. So in
essence, the overhead cancels

01:37:35.441 --> 01:37:37.441
out the benefits of the revenue.

01:37:39.144 --> 01:37:41.144
So I think this is really a self

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.548
destructive measure. It's going
to alienate the public. It's

01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.650
going to hurt businesses, and

01:37:48.887 --> 01:37:50.887
it's basically a loser all the

01:37:52.157 --> 01:37:55.600
way around. And when you want to
extend those parking hours, you

01:37:55.127 --> 01:37:57.127
better think three times before

01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:00.330
you do it. This is a very

01:38:00.699 --> 01:38:02.699
destructive measure. And it

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:06.670
really will not improve service

01:38:06.805 --> 01:38:08.805
delivery from mta. Thank you.

01:38:13.613 --> 01:38:15.613
Thank you. Next speaker. Hello.

01:38:16.315 --> 01:38:18.315
Good afternoon. This is barry

01:38:19.485 --> 01:38:22.387
toronto again. Um, I first want
to applaud you have another

01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:26.890
great employee in the taxi

01:38:26.225 --> 01:38:28.225
division in addition to peter

01:38:28.628 --> 01:38:30.628
woods is scott leone. Scott

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:33.799
leone helps arrange for
temporary taxi stands for

01:38:35.367 --> 01:38:38.170
special events. And I appreciate
what he did to help us while the

01:38:41.607 --> 01:38:43.607
lesbians who are occupying the

01:38:44.911 --> 01:38:46.545
complete block of castro street.
So thank you, scott, for working

01:38:49.316 --> 01:38:51.316
on that project. I want to say,

01:38:51.418 --> 01:38:53.418
though, is that because your

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.122
mobility investigators are
spending more time on scooters,

01:38:57.357 --> 01:38:59.357
we're still having the legal

01:38:59.993 --> 01:39:02.394
solicitations going on in the
cab staging area, particularly

01:39:03.297 --> 01:39:05.898
at chase center. And we're
having a problem with not having

01:39:08.602 --> 01:39:11.303
an investigator after concerts
and basketball games there. Now

01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:13.371
that basketball season is

01:39:14.374 --> 01:39:16.374
starting. Please, please, please

01:39:16.543 --> 01:39:19.178
have investigators work the
basketball games. But know you

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.800
refuse to do it. You refuse to

01:39:24.318 --> 01:39:26.318
do it. Why why? Why? Ask

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.620
director tomlin, why am and I

01:39:30.824 --> 01:39:33.592
want to applaud director so for
bringing up about the patrons

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.731
issue. People get to go to
events at night because of using

01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:42.701
the paratransit debit card at

01:39:44.105 --> 01:39:46.105
and the subsidized rides so they

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:49.776
can afford and go even though
they're seniors and disabled to

01:39:51.612 --> 01:39:53.612
go to a special events and I

01:39:55.249 --> 01:39:57.249
hope that you will be able to

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.550
allow this allow them to have
access to the events because

01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:04.189
we're because if you make it

01:40:05.493 --> 01:40:07.493
tough for vehicles like ramp

01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:09.561
taxis to get to certain places,

01:40:10.965 --> 01:40:13.100
then it's a problem. So again, I
applaud scott leon for making

01:40:14.102 --> 01:40:16.203
arrangements so we can have
access during the market street

01:40:16.838 --> 01:40:18.838
closure so that lighthouse for

01:40:19.107 --> 01:40:21.141
the blind and the mayor's office
of disability. Thank you your

01:40:27.748 --> 01:40:30.718
time is up next. Speaker. Good
afternoon, directors. My name is

01:40:30.719 --> 01:40:32.820
alex landsberg, research and
advocacy director for the san

01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:35.523
francisco electrical
construction industry. I want to

01:40:36.658 --> 01:40:39.560
say a couple of things. First of
all, I tuned in late, so maybe I

01:40:40.928 --> 01:40:42.928
missed it. But in case you are

01:40:43.364 --> 01:40:45.364
or in case other viewers and

01:40:45.967 --> 01:40:48.504
listeners haven't heard, san
francisco is going to be hosting
the international public

01:40:48.504 --> 01:40:51.272
transportation association's
north american trolley committee

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.740
next week. Trolley bus committee

01:40:54.209 --> 01:40:55.843
hearing next week in san
francisco. And I think we should

01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:59.110
be proud of and following on

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.820
that, I wanted to invite you

01:41:02.517 --> 01:41:04.517
directors of staff and other

01:41:06.956 --> 01:41:09.157
members of the public to you, to
a question and answer session

01:41:10.593 --> 01:41:12.560
with andres restrepo and jose
valentin restrepo from the

01:41:14.897 --> 01:41:17.832
universidad pontificia boulevard
. Diana I worked with them to

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
show how san francisco can

01:41:20.102 --> 01:41:22.269
quickly electrify more than 200
miles of diesel powered muni

01:41:23.206 --> 01:41:25.140
routes at a lower cost and with
fewer environmental impacts and

01:41:26.642 --> 01:41:29.344
lower operational costs than
currently envisioned by through

01:41:30.379 --> 01:41:33.214
the battery electric bus
program. Our report shows how we

01:41:34.416 --> 01:41:36.416
and we're bringing andre san

01:41:38.287 --> 01:41:40.321
jose valentin up from medellin
to answer questions, have a

01:41:40.423 --> 01:41:42.423
little reception ahead of the

01:41:44.293 --> 01:41:46.428
uitp people can rsvp at
eventbrite. You can find it in

01:41:49.799 --> 01:41:51.799
eventbrite or at l, igad dot me.

01:41:53.168 --> 01:41:55.168
So with periods in there, it's a

01:41:55.771 --> 01:41:57.771
kind of lead me slash emcee

01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:00.975
trolleys. Next tuesday, 6:00 at

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.680
the ibew hall at 55 fillmore

01:42:08.317 --> 01:42:10.953
thanks. Thank you. Next speaker.
Can you hear me now? Yes. Go

01:42:12.388 --> 01:42:14.990
ahead. Great. David pilpel two
points, I think. Barry toronto

01:42:16.193 --> 01:42:18.193
earlier made referee to two

01:42:19.363 --> 01:42:21.998
people, leaving the mta staff. I
understand that one of them is

01:42:21.998 --> 01:42:23.998
tom maguire, who will be leaving

01:42:25.835 --> 01:42:27.835
mta soon. I wish him well,

01:42:29.639 --> 01:42:31.639
although he is not perfect. None

01:42:32.176 --> 01:42:34.176
of us are. He's a human being,

01:42:34.311 --> 01:42:36.446
but he, in my opinion, he's been
a very decent and honest person

01:42:38.215 --> 01:42:40.616
at mta and mta could certainly
use more decent and honest

01:42:42.219 --> 01:42:44.219
people. And I think it's a big

01:42:45.355 --> 01:42:48.290
loss for mta management and for
the city. So I wish him well.

01:42:49.527 --> 01:42:52.195
And if anyone can straighten out
bart to san jose, good luck to

01:42:54.999 --> 01:42:57.100
him on that. On a separate topic
, the board of supervisors just

01:42:57.368 --> 01:42:59.368
voted to limit remote public

01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:01.470
comment at its meetings. I think

01:43:02.572 --> 01:43:04.572
that was a bad policy choice and

01:43:05.275 --> 01:43:07.275
I hope mta will not follow suit

01:43:07.578 --> 01:43:09.578
and do so. Thanks for listening.

01:43:11.716 --> 01:43:14.517
Thank you. No additional
speakers. Okay, let's close

01:43:15.719 --> 01:43:17.719
public comment and move to the

01:43:17.855 --> 01:43:19.989

board or public wishes to
consider an item separately for

and I'm going to read off

01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:53.157

01:43:53.291 --> 01:43:55.859

available or will be available

01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:58.270
in payment of the following

01:43:58.929 --> 01:44:00.929
claims against the sfmta. That's

01:44:01.867 --> 01:44:03.867
items a and b in the agenda item

01:44:03.969 --> 01:44:06.304

improvements along hyde street

01:44:28.927 --> 01:44:31.395
and the relocation of the heart
of the city farmers market to

01:44:32.564 --> 01:44:34.564
fulton street. That concludes

01:44:34.867 --> 01:44:36.868
your consent calendar. Thank
you. Secretary silva. I will

01:44:37.803 --> 01:44:39.804
open now public comment for
anyone in the room on our

01:44:40.673 --> 01:44:42.673
consent calendar minus item

01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:47.770
10.2. A seeing none. Please open

01:44:47.913 --> 01:44:50.181
remote at this time. We'll move
to remote public comment not to

01:44:50.816 --> 01:44:52.951
exceed a total time of ten
minutes. Members of the public

01:44:53.386 --> 01:44:56.154
wishing to comment should dial
star three to enter the queue.

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.556
Each speaker will have two

01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:02.928
minutes. Moderator first speaker
great david paypal again, i

01:45:03.996 --> 01:45:06.664
assume I can be heard. I just
had a brief comment on item

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.700
10.3. I don't think it needs to

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.604
be pulled. I note that page two
of the staff report has a

01:45:13.372 --> 01:45:15.372
section on stakeholder

01:45:15.775 --> 01:45:18.677
engagement, but really only
discusses what stakeholder

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:22.614
engagement occurred and does not
really summarize the input

01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:25.516
gleaned from that stakeholder

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.789
engagement that is not the same

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:33.325
as some of the other items that

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:38.300
have some different and in some
cases more discussion on

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:41.433
stakeholder engagement. I think
it's important to have that

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:44.336
section in staff reports and I
think it's important not just to

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.771
document what stakeholder

01:45:46.974 --> 01:45:48.974
engagement events occurred and

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.780
what mta staff broadcast to the

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:55.981
stakeholders, but what input was
received from stakeholders and

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.883
much more importantly, what

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:01.754
changes were made to the
proposals as a result of that

01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:05.230
stakeholder engagement. And this

01:46:05.426 --> 01:46:07.594
applies not just to item 10.3,
but throughout to all items

01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:11.330
today and in the future. Thanks

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.665
for listening. Thank you. No

01:46:13.901 --> 01:46:15.901
additional speakers. Okay, we'll

01:46:54.843 --> 01:46:56.843
through saturday, OCTOBER 19,

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.580
2024. 1 P.M. To 10 P.M. Each

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:03.820
saturday. We have staff here.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.100
Thank you.

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.187
Good afternoon, chair egan
directors. Thank you so much for

01:47:39.221 --> 01:47:41.221
having me this afternoon. My

01:47:41.823 --> 01:47:44.525
name is monica minich. I'm the
program manager of shared spaces

01:47:45.727 --> 01:47:48.163
and happy to be presenting to
you all today on the application

01:47:48.697 --> 01:47:50.765
we've received and have been
working closely with the

01:47:51.133 --> 01:47:53.133
community on to close the 400

01:47:53.335 --> 01:47:56.304
block of hay street and hayes
valley as part of the shared

01:47:57.273 --> 01:47:59.340
spaces post-pandemic program.
Um, I prepared a brief

01:47:59.742 --> 01:48:01.742
presentation on the background

01:48:01.877 --> 01:48:03.877
of the application and program

01:48:04.247 --> 01:48:05.781
and what led us to the
recommendation, the staff

01:48:06.549 --> 01:48:08.549
recommendation here in front of

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.890
you today. So shared spaces is
was established over the

01:48:15.191 --> 01:48:17.191
pandemic. It was intended to

01:48:17.226 --> 01:48:19.226
make a place outside possible

01:48:21.309 --> 01:48:22.740
for the neighborhood and
business districts and
restaurants and businesses to be

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.350
outside when it wasn't safe to
operate indoors through in the

01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:28.970
form of parklets roadway

01:48:29.138 --> 01:48:31.138
closures, sidewalk tables and

01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:33.140
chairs when it really was such a

01:48:33.342 --> 01:48:35.644
desperate time to be outdoors,
it brought people together. It

01:48:36.479 --> 01:48:38.479
brought communities together. It

01:48:38.647 --> 01:48:40.716
really was a delight and has
continued to be a delight

01:48:41.818 --> 01:48:43.818
throughout our city. In the

01:48:44.254 --> 01:48:47.122
summer of 2021, the mayor signed
legislation to make shared

01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:49.590
spaces permanent and here to

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.961
stay to allow our economy and
business districts and small

01:48:53.763 --> 01:48:55.763
businesses to continue to

01:48:56.132 --> 01:48:58.868
leverage this and activate our
public spaces, shared spaces for

01:48:59.936 --> 01:49:02.405
street closures are typically
approved by the

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.241
inter-departmental staff
committee of traffic and

01:49:05.642 --> 01:49:07.642
transportation. This is chaired

01:49:07.878 --> 01:49:10.613
by sfmta with representation
from public works fire

01:49:11.748 --> 01:49:13.649
department fire. Fire
department. Police entertainment

01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:17.820
commission. Public health. But
this application is brought to

01:49:19.256 --> 01:49:21.290
you today as the board to take
action because of the 21 muni

01:49:22.259 --> 01:49:24.259
route that serves this street

01:49:24.528 --> 01:49:27.129
and the reroute needed to
accommodate this closure, which

01:49:27.764 --> 01:49:29.764
requires a necessitates the

01:49:32.370 --> 01:49:34.370
board share shared spaces versus

01:49:35.873 --> 01:49:37.873
slow streets two programs that

01:49:37.975 --> 01:49:40.677
started during the pandemic,
each very different and I just

01:49:41.712 --> 01:49:44.647
want to highlight so we're sort
of this is covered and

01:49:45.349 --> 01:49:47.350
intentionally sort of discuss
the differences between both

01:49:47.751 --> 01:49:50.521
programs. Shared spaces are
intended to be destinations.

01:49:52.657 --> 01:49:55.125
These are intended to be on
commercial corridors. They have

01:49:55.493 --> 01:49:57.527
sponsors that are responsible
for activating the space and

01:49:59.931 --> 01:50:01.931
setting it up, and they are

01:50:02.433 --> 01:50:04.534
recurring, recurring in nature.
These are different than blocks

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.300
that MAY be closed for a special
event shared spaces are

01:50:07.772 --> 01:50:09.772
recurring slow streets, as we're

01:50:09.808 --> 01:50:11.808
well aware, are on residential

01:50:12.377 --> 01:50:14.377
corridors. These are traffic on

01:50:15.146 --> 01:50:17.814
streets that are slow and
accommodate all modes of

01:50:19.784 --> 01:50:22.520
transportation. It's a really a
new sort of framework and

01:50:22.988 --> 01:50:24.988
typology for people to get from

01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.390
point a to point b, this is a

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.229
form of mobility. Shared spaces.
Some things we look at, although

01:50:32.464 --> 01:50:35.399
not required, but most shared
spaces throughout the city and

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.801
from the post-pandemic permanent
program. I think we've permitted

01:50:38.637 --> 01:50:40.971
about over 30 of them are
typically on streets without

01:50:41.974 --> 01:50:44.842
public transit, bike lanes on
low volume streets without fire

01:50:46.211 --> 01:50:48.880
or emergency c or medical
facilities and likely few

01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:52.750
driveways. So there's not a lot
of public access needed to be

01:50:53.885 --> 01:50:55.885
maintained. So not not possible,

01:50:56.254 --> 01:50:58.822
but additional analysis like
hayes street MAY be required to

01:51:03.896 --> 01:51:05.896
confirm feasible city. So now to

01:51:06.332 --> 01:51:08.533
get into a little bit more of
the specifics on hay street,

01:51:09.968 --> 01:51:12.503
when on the 21 hayes bus line
was not operating during the

01:51:13.138 --> 01:51:16.400
pandemic, the hayes valley
neighborhood association and
hayes valley merchant council

01:51:17.943 --> 01:51:20.679
applied for a street closure on
the three, four and 500 block

01:51:20.746 --> 01:51:23.515
for fridays, saturdays and
sundays. And they operated in

01:51:24.483 --> 01:51:27.252
that configuration for, I
believe, well over a year. There

01:51:27.319 --> 01:51:29.187
were some iterations of the
permit during that time, notably

01:51:31.657 --> 01:51:33.657
the end of 2021. It was scaled

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:36.260
to be its current form of 400

01:51:36.396 --> 01:51:38.931
block only for friday, saturday
and sundays due to community

01:51:39.732 --> 01:51:42.534
opposition and traffic
circulation issues. Then fast

01:51:45.771 --> 01:51:47.771
forward. To summer 2022, the 21

01:51:48.574 --> 01:51:50.574
hayes came back and we were able

01:51:50.976 --> 01:51:53.345
to find a way to work with the
community to continue to reroute

01:51:53.346 --> 01:51:56.181
muni to serve and allow the
closure to happen every friday,

01:51:56.249 --> 01:51:58.249
saturday and sunday. And that's

01:51:59.152 --> 01:52:01.152
what's been in place since the

01:52:01.154 --> 01:52:03.755
pandemic program ended in MARCH
2023. So we've been in this

01:52:04.824 --> 01:52:06.824
transition and hayes valley

01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.561
merchants council submit an
application to continue the

01:52:10.497 --> 01:52:13.366
closure friday, saturday and
sundays, fridays for 210

01:52:14.368 --> 01:52:17.102
saturdays, sundays, 10 A.M. To
10 P.M. In the post-pandemic

01:52:21.541 --> 01:52:23.541
program. And just a high level

01:52:25.812 --> 01:52:28.515
to orient the three 400 block
that we've been speaking and

01:52:28.649 --> 01:52:31.384
we'll be speaking most about
today is that block between

01:52:31.485 --> 01:52:34.530
gough and octavia, 300 between
franklin and gough, and the 500

01:52:34.588 --> 01:52:36.588
block is between octavia and

01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:44.610
laguna. Hayes street has been a

01:52:44.365 --> 01:52:46.365
beloved community space during

01:52:46.567 --> 01:52:49.302
the pandemic. Residents report
it loving to walk and gather and

01:52:50.638 --> 01:52:53.573
be in this space. And some
businesses have noted additional

01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:56.509
foot traffic, foot traffic that
has supported their business

01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:02.830
during the pandemic time over
the course of the permit. The

01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:04.830
closure has also experiences

01:53:04.185 --> 01:53:06.185
some challenges. Many merchants

01:53:06.854 --> 01:53:08.855
we've worked with and spoken to
would like to see more regular

01:53:11.258 --> 01:53:13.258
activation of the space sponsors

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.695
have a lot of responsibility
when they close the street. They

01:53:15.963 --> 01:53:17.630
have to set up the barricades,
take them down, activate the

01:53:19.901 --> 01:53:21.901
space and in inspecting the

01:53:22.537 --> 01:53:25.139
closure during the period that
it was activated ad the

01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.675
applicant was not able to do
this reliably. The barricades,

01:53:30.712 --> 01:53:32.712
for example, were not always set

01:53:32.713 --> 01:53:35.160
up at the same location, and we
were really committed to working

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:37.500
closely with them and came up
actually with a revised

01:53:38.419 --> 01:53:41.880
barricade set up within the last
year that reduced the ability or

01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:44.291
the need to have staffing at the
intersection. The staffing was

01:53:44.793 --> 01:53:47.270
needed to move barricades in the
event of an emergency, and we

01:53:47.762 --> 01:53:49.696
worked together as a city team
revise the barricades set up to

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.334
eliminate the staff need that
there really having a challenge

01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:57.270
to do consistently and reliably.

01:53:57.706 --> 01:53:59.707
unfortunately I think with
inspections, we still were

01:53:59.908 --> 01:54:02.142
seeing inconsistency in setting
up the barricades during that

01:54:05.146 --> 01:54:07.180
time. Other notable things that
we've observed and have been

01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:10.318
reported and many merchants talk
about the traffic congestion

01:54:10.318 --> 01:54:12.318
affecting their businesses,

01:54:12.488 --> 01:54:15.156
particularly on the 300 block is
illustrated here for and the

01:54:15.558 --> 01:54:18.920
impacts just to general
circulation having on their

01:54:19.795 --> 01:54:21.795
customers and on the business

01:54:21.997 --> 01:54:23.997
deliveries and pickups needed to

01:54:26.435 --> 01:54:28.435
support their businesses. Lastly

01:54:28.637 --> 01:54:30.639
we've had a lot of reports on
double parking at the

01:54:31.207 --> 01:54:33.875
intersection as particularly at
gough and also on octavia

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.440
blocking the barricades and

01:54:37.346 --> 01:54:39.346
really becoming a traffic safety

01:54:40.416 --> 01:54:42.416
and emergency access issue.

01:54:42.418 --> 01:54:44.418
We've also received reports from

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.556
muni about the reroute over the
course of the pandemic, about

01:54:48.791 --> 01:54:51.493
passengers impacted from the new
bus stops friday, saturdays and

01:54:52.295 --> 01:54:55.230
sundays every week. Two
operators sort of trying to

01:54:55.264 --> 01:54:57.432
navigate the closure. I
understand. And the friday

01:54:58.534 --> 01:55:00.969
service operates out of the
presidio yard. Our trolley bus

01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:02.970
overhead wires, which are

01:55:03.405 --> 01:55:05.405
uniquely a little bit less

01:55:05.408 --> 01:55:08.377
nimble and how they come off
wire and have to reroute that is

01:55:08.878 --> 01:55:10.946
presented just on fridays
compared to the service on

01:55:12.515 --> 01:55:14.549
saturday and sundays. So some of
the observations have been

01:55:16.886 --> 01:55:18.886
reported and identified over the

01:55:20.156 --> 01:55:22.156
last couple of years. This

01:55:22.292 --> 01:55:24.292
summer, staff convened

01:55:24.561 --> 01:55:26.561
stakeholders upon receiving the

01:55:26.596 --> 01:55:29.565
application to continue in the
post pandemic program and met

01:55:30.534 --> 01:55:32.534
with merchant and neighborhood

01:55:32.636 --> 01:55:35.371
groups and really tried to all
come together. Those that oppose

01:55:36.673 --> 01:55:38.673
and support all in one space to

01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:41.143
provide a space and a seat at
the table to hear concerns and

01:55:41.812 --> 01:55:44.792
identify sustainable solutions.
So while I'm here presenting

01:55:45.782 --> 01:55:48.351
this today, the recommendations
that we bring in front of you

01:55:49.286 --> 01:55:52.210
are really a representation of
our work with the neighborhood

01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:56.460
and the merchants advocates, the
office of small business, the
fire department, the mayor's

01:55:58.862 --> 01:56:01.300
office, and our recommendations
really are a direct result of

01:56:04.635 --> 01:56:06.635
all of that feedback, like. So

01:56:06.937 --> 01:56:09.405
to get into now more specifics
on what the proposal that was

01:56:10.474 --> 01:56:13.109
brought forward to the to the
group of stakeholders we met

01:56:13.276 --> 01:56:15.479
with as a result of those
conversations, there's a common

01:56:16.547 --> 01:56:19.449
theme the community loves this
space and they want to see it

01:56:20.618 --> 01:56:22.618
continue in some form. They want

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.620
it to be activated and well

01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:27.457
managed, monitored for safety
and consistent and reflect the

01:56:28.825 --> 01:56:30.825
diverse needs of the corridor.

01:56:33.898 --> 01:56:35.899
So I'll briefly list out all of
these and I have some follow up

01:56:36.801 --> 01:56:38.801
slides to go into them in more

01:56:38.936 --> 01:56:40.938
detail. But one of the main
recommendations was scaling back

01:56:41.205 --> 01:56:43.205
to a one day only closure,

01:56:43.407 --> 01:56:45.308
having it be more intentional so
we could focus the resources and

01:56:45.743 --> 01:56:48.678
set it up for success so they
can see and build upon that

01:56:49.881 --> 01:56:51.949
success and that stability and
the sponsor being able to

01:56:53.985 --> 01:56:56.887
activate the space. We were open
to the day and try to sort of

01:56:57.522 --> 01:57:00.223
feedback. If it was one day with
friday feel better saturdays and

01:57:00.424 --> 01:57:03.393
sundays and ultimately at
present suggested a saturday

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:08.199
because of the level of activity
on that day compared to a

01:57:08.433 --> 01:57:11.202
sunday, for example. Well we'd
like to see more regular

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.839
activation. There are resources
for this. The shared spaces

01:57:16.341 --> 01:57:18.341
program in and of itself has an

01:57:18.343 --> 01:57:20.110
arts and culture grant that they
could apply for to get things

01:57:21.312 --> 01:57:23.312
like music and art and really

01:57:23.616 --> 01:57:25.616
enliven the space. And then we

01:57:26.318 --> 01:57:28.553
also have a host of signage and
wayfinding requirements and

01:57:30.355 --> 01:57:32.560
ideas to bring forth that will
hopefully manage the space

01:57:33.191 --> 01:57:35.191
better, that include includes

01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:38.195
this new barricade setup that we
developed with working with fire

01:57:38.263 --> 01:57:40.263
department and our engineers

01:57:41.134 --> 01:57:43.335
that places the barricades out
side of the crosswalk instead of

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:46.371
inside of the crosswalk. This
hopefully eliminates the

01:57:48.106 --> 01:57:50.708
additional space and sort of
invites the double parking, the

01:57:51.743 --> 01:57:53.945
illegal parking that we were
seeing at the intersection. So

01:57:56.115 --> 01:57:58.115
we propose this at octavia and

01:57:58.785 --> 01:58:01.860
at sorry, at gough and octavia
with that sort of art shape with

01:58:02.656 --> 01:58:04.723
a similar thread of thinking,
sort of reducing that extra

01:58:05.691 --> 01:58:08.360
space that was there with the
barricade setup during the

01:58:11.964 --> 01:58:13.498
pandemic. And then the
additional wayfinding and

01:58:14.866 --> 01:58:16.866
loading and signage just to walk

01:58:17.437 --> 01:58:19.437
through that here on southbound

01:58:19.439 --> 01:58:21.439
gough, we like to put a no right

01:58:22.575 --> 01:58:24.676
turn ahead sign up so that it's
clear to drivers coming down

01:58:24.811 --> 01:58:26.811
southbound on gough that hay

01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:29.681
street is closed and they can
circulate through the
neighborhood hopefully easier.

01:58:31.651 --> 01:58:33.718
We've legislated new commercial
and passenger loading zones on

01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:36.621
hayes just south I'm sorry on

01:58:37.157 --> 01:58:39.925
gough just south of hayes as
well as new passenger loading

01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:43.662
zone in the works on octavia
just north of hayes. We'd like

01:58:44.898 --> 01:58:47.533
to put additional no parking
signage on the barricades

01:58:48.534 --> 01:58:50.536
themselves so that it's clear
that shouldn't be happening

01:58:51.505 --> 01:58:54.474
there and also suggested that
businesses put out specific

01:58:55.275 --> 01:58:57.276
wayfinding signage at the
loading zone for their

01:58:57.744 --> 01:58:59.744
businesses to support that

01:59:00.781 --> 01:59:02.781
visibility. Again mta provides

01:59:02.983 --> 01:59:04.983
these barricades and signage to

01:59:06.419 --> 01:59:08.419
the sponsor at no cost. And they

01:59:08.489 --> 01:59:10.489
have to store it, maintain it,

01:59:11.859 --> 01:59:13.859
set it up. But we provide this

01:59:15.696 --> 01:59:17.696
to all of our permits. So I want

01:59:17.798 --> 01:59:19.798
to acknowledge that the permit

01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:24.350
holder, upon receiving the

01:59:24.204 --> 01:59:27.730
feedback and the supervisor
office, felt strongly that the
event time should remain the

01:59:28.743 --> 01:59:31.678
same. We recognize the event is
loved by many and some things

01:59:33.547 --> 01:59:35.815
were not working well and we'd
want to see this succeed. And we

01:59:37.251 --> 01:59:39.251
want to really have this be a

01:59:39.753 --> 01:59:41.753
reset. So I share this because

01:59:42.256 --> 01:59:44.725
there's sort of six after that
time, there was additional

01:59:45.393 --> 01:59:48.228
feedback done after the
recommendation was shared with

01:59:49.197 --> 01:59:51.698
the stakeholders. Hayes valley
did their own membership survey

01:59:53.467 --> 01:59:55.535
and heard from neighbors who
overwhelmingly want to see the

01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:58.538
street closure continue. We also
partnered with the office of

01:59:59.306 --> 02:00:01.306
small business, who went door to

02:00:01.343 --> 02:00:04.780
door on the three, four and 500
block. And I believe spoke to 59

02:00:06.581 --> 02:00:08.581
of the 64 merchants. So over 90.

02:00:09.918 --> 02:00:11.918
And have a really good idea of

02:00:12.386 --> 02:00:14.555
their needs in addition to the
neighbors and while a minority

02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:17.790
we heard from don't want it at

02:00:20.295 --> 02:00:22.295
all and some wanted the same the

02:00:23.298 --> 02:00:25.298
majority 66% wanted a one day or

02:00:27.202 --> 02:00:29.470
were neutral about a one day. So
to show that a little bit more

02:00:31.339 --> 02:00:33.841
visually see this graph shows
again those door to door small

02:00:33.842 --> 02:00:36.743
office, small business surveys
and you can see on the third

02:00:39.715 --> 02:00:41.715
bar, that's the group, the ten

02:00:42.551 --> 02:00:44.719
responses that we heard that 16%
that wanted to keep friday,

02:00:45.554 --> 02:00:48.890
saturday and sunday, most of
them are on the 400 block. Some

02:00:48.957 --> 02:00:51.826
of them came from the 400 block.
So it's clear those right on the

02:00:53.396 --> 02:00:55.396
block are really are activating

02:00:57.166 --> 02:00:59.166
and enjoying that space. We also

02:00:59.435 --> 02:01:01.136
heard that a lot of businesses
did not feel comfortable

02:01:02.871 --> 02:01:05.600
publicly voicing their concerns.
So we've kept their responses

02:01:08.610 --> 02:01:10.610
anonymous as. In conclusion,

02:01:12.682 --> 02:01:14.883
this is not about a one day or a
three day closure. This is about

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:17.886
reset ing and rebuilding that
trust in the community and

02:01:18.621 --> 02:01:21.489
making a process so it's
possible that the block can work

02:01:22.525 --> 02:01:24.826
well and get to 24 over seven.
And it wasn't working for some

02:01:26.328 --> 02:01:28.496
merchants. And that's not a
reason to cancel it entirely. We

02:01:29.650 --> 02:01:31.650
really want an opportunity to

02:01:31.734 --> 02:01:34.503
grow and expand. On the success
in hayes valley and see it

02:01:36.272 --> 02:01:38.540
thrive. So with that, that
concludes my presentation and

02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:41.877
happy to answer any questions.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:01:42.812 --> 02:01:45.647
Colleagues, do you have
questions before we go to public

02:01:47.651 --> 02:01:49.651
comment at DR. Ikuko? Just one.

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.554
I have I have feelings about
this, but my clarifying question

02:01:53.256 --> 02:01:55.958
to you is there have been some
talk of asking us to do some

02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.160
kind of study on what it would

02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:03.631
take to make this permanent and
what's your thoughts on on doing

02:02:06.537 --> 02:02:08.537
that kind of study? Yeah, it's

02:02:08.672 --> 02:02:10.672
would be amazing to pedestrian

02:02:11.410 --> 02:02:13.410
personally the space I think

02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:15.744
that we should leverage upon a
pilot type program that shared

02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:19.815
spaces provides so often we go
in with a blank slate go forward

02:02:19.983 --> 02:02:22.652
with a pilot and then evaluate
results. We've had three years

02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:25.520
to kind of build off of. So I

02:02:26.256 --> 02:02:28.691
think that that would be a great
process that I would love to be

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.560
part of. And I think to move

02:02:31.562 --> 02:02:33.629
that forward, we really need to
kind of have merchants brought

02:02:33.997 --> 02:02:36.231
along iron out some of the
issues we have been experiencing

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.300
over the last couple of years to
see if it really is a long term

02:02:40.104 --> 02:02:42.572
viable solution for all the
merchants in the corridor. And

02:02:42.873 --> 02:02:45.742
you said that this is kind of
like it feels a little bit like

02:02:46.377 --> 02:02:48.845
a timeout where you're like, go
back to your room and think

02:02:49.213 --> 02:02:52.148
about what you've done. Kind of
vibes. How long is this timeout

02:02:53.251 --> 02:02:55.117
in your mind? Like how long do
you want to see that the

02:02:55.452 --> 02:02:57.452
merchants are able to run this

02:02:57.522 --> 02:02:59.523
block before they can? It's a
good question. I mean, we what's

02:03:01.325 --> 02:03:03.560
in front of you is a one year
permit and that's consists joint

02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:06.496
with the other shared spaces we
brought forward and that's in to

02:03:06.797 --> 02:03:09.666
provide stability for the
community. But we very well

02:03:10.434 --> 02:03:12.434
could talk about a three month

02:03:12.703 --> 02:03:14.703
or a six month period. I don't

02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.750
know if that means the permits 3
or 6 months or we just commit to

02:03:18.209 --> 02:03:20.278
an evaluation time that we are
resourcing, are transparent

02:03:20.278 --> 02:03:22.278
about what the metrics we want

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.820
to see. I think anything less
than that, I think there's a

02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:27.884
there's a lot of work that goes
behind, as you know, to get

02:03:29.921 --> 02:03:31.989
these going. I probably wouldn't
suggest less than three months,

02:03:33.959 --> 02:03:35.959
but. All right. Thank you. Thank

02:03:35.994 --> 02:03:37.994
you. Director henderson. Thank

02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:40.831
you, chair. I have a couple
questions. Just I appreciate the

02:03:42.534 --> 02:03:44.769
amount of what sounds like a lot
of staff work that went into to

02:03:44.769 --> 02:03:46.769
working with the community to

02:03:48.106 --> 02:03:50.908
identify a path forward. And I
have a question about the timing

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.110
for this. It's a one year
permit. So then what happens?

02:03:54.413 --> 02:03:56.413
What should we expect in a

02:03:57.382 --> 02:04:00.219
year's time? Um, would it have
to? Would it? Yeah. What should

02:04:00.986 --> 02:04:02.986
we expect in a year's time?

02:04:03.354 --> 02:04:05.354
Yeah. All sponsors have to

02:04:06.191 --> 02:04:07.959
reapply, so they're kind of like
parklets as well. They're sort

02:04:09.394 --> 02:04:11.430
of still temporary activations
of the street. So these are, for

02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:14.265
all intents and purposes,
temporary permits. So a sponsor

02:04:15.367 --> 02:04:17.435
gets permitted for a year, and
after that point they can

02:04:19.238 --> 02:04:21.238
reapply. Okay. And then do you

02:04:23.108 --> 02:04:25.108
have any in terms of considering

02:04:26.912 --> 02:04:29.781
a permanent programing of the
space in this way? Is there a

02:04:31.717 --> 02:04:33.717
process or some sort of way that

02:04:33.752 --> 02:04:36.387
the community and the staff can
commune, skate during that

02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:40.258
during that year to be able to
consider something more

02:04:40.793 --> 02:04:42.793
permanent or like I'm just

02:04:44.631 --> 02:04:47.499
curious, how do do we have to
wait a year to have that

02:04:48.434 --> 02:04:50.434
conversation about expanding it

02:04:51.304 --> 02:04:53.905
potentially? No, thank you for
asking so I can provide

02:04:54.106 --> 02:04:56.106
clarification. No by all means.

02:04:56.842 --> 02:04:58.842
At a minimum, it can be a year,

02:04:59.279 --> 02:05:01.513
but we can entertain at any
time. A permit scope can change

02:05:01.948 --> 02:05:03.948
and we can bring it back to the

02:05:04.351 --> 02:05:06.751
board and permit if we see after
three months, we want to grow or

02:05:08.588 --> 02:05:10.588
revoke. It's not has to wait for

02:05:10.723 --> 02:05:13.325
a year. But thanks for asking.
Got it. Thank you. Of course.

02:05:16.130 --> 02:05:19.650
Thank you, director. So thank
you, monica. Really nice

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.690
presentation. I like all the
graphics. It really paints

02:05:24.104 --> 02:05:26.104
really clear. Picture for me to

02:05:27.741 --> 02:05:30.275
understand what has been going
on and also what are the

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.480
proposed traffic cone layout. I

02:05:35.983 --> 02:05:37.983
like to what you mentioned about

02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:41.420
some some of the incident or

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:45.560
concern from our fire

02:05:46.293 --> 02:05:48.293
department. I like to know if

02:05:48.361 --> 02:05:50.361
can you enlighten us a little

02:05:51.165 --> 02:05:53.165
bit about about what are the

02:05:53.634 --> 02:05:55.634
situations that are concerning

02:05:56.737 --> 02:05:59.639
for public safety? I mean, I'm
really aware of that whole area.

02:06:00.574 --> 02:06:02.574
I live nearby by all that area

02:06:03.844 --> 02:06:05.844
and golf street. It's like a

02:06:06.446 --> 02:06:08.814
major thoroughfare to, you know,
everyone just racing down that

02:06:11.586 --> 02:06:14.354
street and I just want to hear
when you mention some of these

02:06:16.230 --> 02:06:18.230
situation options where, when,

02:06:18.893 --> 02:06:20.893
when, when folks double park and

02:06:21.228 --> 02:06:23.228
congested that intersection and

02:06:23.731 --> 02:06:25.731
what are the concerns about when

02:06:26.234 --> 02:06:28.602
this street is I just want to
hear historically what we have

02:06:29.104 --> 02:06:31.104
learned. What are the concerns?

02:06:35.376 --> 02:06:37.376
Of course. Yes. Thank you so 400

02:06:37.478 --> 02:06:39.479
block has a is dense with
restaurants and businesses that

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:42.449
get a lot of activity. If
someone is traveling in a

02:06:42.650 --> 02:06:45.252
vehicle down southbound golf,
which as you know, is a big

02:06:46.321 --> 02:06:48.321
thoroughfare, they get to haze.

02:06:48.957 --> 02:06:50.957
They can't turn right because

02:06:51.590 --> 02:06:53.600
the block is closed. So
naturally, we're seeing them

02:06:54.195 --> 02:06:56.496
just get illegally double parked
at the barricades. So basically

02:06:56.865 --> 02:06:59.800
in the middle of the
intersection, not blocking the

02:07:01.436 --> 02:07:03.604
lane of traffic per se, but
there's enough space there that

02:07:05.941 --> 02:07:08.609
they'll just do the quickest
thing possible. And then they go

02:07:09.845 --> 02:07:11.745
out and get to the restaurant or
business on the block and get

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:13.880
back to their car. The

02:07:13.949 --> 02:07:16.116
businesses have told us they
don't like that. They they the

02:07:16.351 --> 02:07:18.919
setup is detrimental to their
business. And we've heard from

02:07:19.210 --> 02:07:21.210
folks like san francisco fire

02:07:21.123 --> 02:07:22.757
department, what if there's an
emergency and there's a blocked

02:07:24.293 --> 02:07:26.227
car in the way they can't get
there, their truck down. So

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:29.997
hopefully a new barricade set up
and creating additional loading

02:07:31.330 --> 02:07:33.330
zone just south of hayes will

02:07:33.435 --> 02:07:36.236
and better signage will kind of
alleviate that. But I don't know

02:07:36.506 --> 02:07:38.740
if you had specific questions
broader than that specific

02:07:40.676 --> 02:07:42.676
activity. Me but that is my

02:07:42.678 --> 02:07:44.678
question is any incident or

02:07:46.749 --> 02:07:48.749
collectively we had alerts at

02:07:49.952 --> 02:07:51.952
our agency to flag this is a

02:07:52.821 --> 02:07:54.821
pretty dangerous kind of way to

02:07:55.191 --> 02:07:57.191
arrange the street the way we

02:07:59.662 --> 02:08:01.662
are. Like if anyone had been

02:08:04.934 --> 02:08:06.934
injured by this or I mean, yeah,

02:08:10.907 --> 02:08:12.907
no, I'm not aware of an a crash

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:15.944
per se, but we do have the fire
marshal here in the room and I'd

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.648
love to invite him up to kind of
respond directly to at least

02:08:19.649 --> 02:08:21.950
from their perspective, what
they're seeing for emergency

02:08:22.118 --> 02:08:23.952
response time. I don't if that's
pertinent to your question, but

02:08:24.687 --> 02:08:26.687
that would be I'd love to have

02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:29.292
them come up. Thank you. And
also, I know mary thompson, who

02:08:29.793 --> 02:08:32.661
I know has to leave at 330, and
he's here with the office of

02:08:32.729 --> 02:08:34.729
small business. She wanted to

02:08:35.432 --> 02:08:37.967
speak as well at at some point
when that's relevant and
important. Thank you. Good

02:08:40.636 --> 02:08:43.238
afternoon, chair egan. Directors
ken coughlin, your fire marshal.

02:08:43.606 --> 02:08:46.174
I want to answer your question.
I see where you're going with

02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:48.810
that. Not physical instance, but

02:08:48.846 --> 02:08:50.846
the problem is that hay street

02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:53.282
and that block is a route for
our battalion chiefs and

02:08:54.484 --> 02:08:56.484
sometimes our engines that cross

02:08:56.987 --> 02:08:59.922
town. So we have webster,
webster and almost here we have

02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.758
a firehouse and we have another
one at oak and franklin, and we

02:09:04.195 --> 02:09:06.395
have battalion chiefs who run a
section of town. And every time

02:09:07.264 --> 02:09:09.232
you have a fire in building
smoke, call, building alarm,

02:09:09.433 --> 02:09:11.433
they have to respond one way or

02:09:11.835 --> 02:09:14.670
another. And unfortunately, the
their response area is not nice

02:09:17.574 --> 02:09:19.642
little blocks. It's kind of it's
interesting. It's been that way

02:09:21.179 --> 02:09:24.470
for a long time. Anyway, as we
this closure, which monica

02:09:24.915 --> 02:09:27.830
didn't mention, actually has a
20 foot access lane down the

02:09:27.918 --> 02:09:30.220
center. Okay. Because there are
still buildings. There are there

02:09:31.455 --> 02:09:33.790
are still restaurants there. We
still have to respond, whether

02:09:34.592 --> 02:09:36.192
it be a medical or a fire, more
likely a medical call. So the

02:09:36.693 --> 02:09:38.962
rearrangement of the cones was
to allow the fire department to

02:09:38.963 --> 02:09:41.899
get through there without
actually having a monitor to

02:09:42.667 --> 02:09:45.435
move the cones, because we
noticed that was a problem.

02:09:46.337 --> 02:09:49.139
Specifically, it would be those
cars that were double parked for

02:09:50.241 --> 02:09:52.241
food pickup deliveries that the

02:09:52.843 --> 02:09:55.645
chief the engines, the trucks
tried to get through. And all of

02:09:57.382 --> 02:09:59.750
a sudden there's a car there and
they just couldn't get through.

02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:02.119
So that's the that's more of the
type of incidents we ran into

02:10:03.488 --> 02:10:05.527
and that's why we worked
together with sfmta to

02:10:05.623 --> 02:10:07.959
reconfigure the cones, to bring
them out. So we don't have that

02:10:07.959 --> 02:10:09.959
legal parking at the

02:10:09.994 --> 02:10:11.994
intersection and blocking the

02:10:12.998 --> 02:10:14.998
crosswalk. So what you said, not

02:10:15.901 --> 02:10:17.901
specific, harmed anybody more of

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:20.200
a delay. The harm would be have

02:10:20.438 --> 02:10:22.306
to be analyzed afterwards. If
somebody didn't get there on

02:10:25.389 --> 02:10:28.312
time. Thank you. I really
appreciate your your expertise
and what is the traffic cone

02:10:30.215 --> 02:10:32.215
look like now? What does it look

02:10:33.385 --> 02:10:36.120
like now? Yes the way the cones
are, they will they type to

02:10:37.122 --> 02:10:39.190
barricade? Is that the type
three barricades at the end?

02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:41.792
That's what the larger ones with
the slats. And then they have

02:10:43.395 --> 02:10:45.496
just simple cones in there. What
we've asked and worked with is

02:10:46.465 --> 02:10:48.967
to still use the type three
barricades. But space the cones

02:10:50.336 --> 02:10:52.403
a little bit larger so we can
still get through without

02:10:52.671 --> 02:10:55.573
running them over. If you run
them over the wrong way, then

02:10:55.841 --> 02:10:57.841
they get stuck on the wheel well

02:10:58.544 --> 02:11:00.879
. Now you got more of a bigger
problem. You're going to ruin a

02:11:00.879 --> 02:11:03.781
million dollar fire engine. So
the thing is, the idea is to

02:11:04.316 --> 02:11:07.185
have quick access directly
through the lane without and
then also some cooperation with

02:11:07.453 --> 02:11:09.821
the operator side of the
merchants. Right. Well the

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.580
permit says you cannot put
anything permanent in that

02:11:14.727 --> 02:11:16.327
space. We're not worried about
people walking in the street.

02:11:17.129 --> 02:11:19.698
They tend to move out of the way
when you have a big red fire

02:11:19.698 --> 02:11:21.698
engine making lots of noise and

02:11:22.468 --> 02:11:24.536
coming down at you. So that's
not the problem. It's the it's

02:11:24.704 --> 02:11:27.720
keeping the physical items out
of the street tables and

02:11:27.173 --> 02:11:29.374
barricades and things like that.
I believe the permit actually

02:11:29.642 --> 02:11:31.810
even calls for cones to mark
down the street to say this is

02:11:32.679 --> 02:11:35.547
how far you can come out, you
know, put tables and chairs in

02:11:35.982 --> 02:11:37.982
the parking place and even a

02:11:38.351 --> 02:11:40.652
little bit wider. But leave this
area clear. So you MAY have

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:43.389
heard of instances where we've
driven down the street. That's

02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:46.250
what it's for. We are we do use
it as a response route. We have

02:11:46.793 --> 02:11:48.793
used it to get from one side of

02:11:49.295 --> 02:11:51.463
town to the other. As you know,
oak street fell street. They've

02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:54.100
gotten quite busier over the
years as some type of

02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:56.301
reconfiguration. So hayes is an
important cross town pathway for

02:11:58.672 --> 02:12:01.374
us. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank
you. Colleagues, I'd like to ask

02:12:01.441 --> 02:12:04.277
marianne thompson from office of
small business to address the

02:12:05.278 --> 02:12:07.278
board so she has to leave at

02:12:09.449 --> 02:12:11.449
330. Thank you. Board members.

02:12:13.219 --> 02:12:15.219
Thank you, monica. Thank you. So

02:12:16.190 --> 02:12:18.324
in the last few months, the
office of small business has

02:12:19.526 --> 02:12:22.462
engaged very strongly with
sfmta. It's important for us

02:12:23.464 --> 02:12:26.299
that the voice of small
businesses be heard, and this

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
has really been a great process

02:12:30.871 --> 02:12:32.871
in many ways. What sfmta did was

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.800
they enabled us to bring many

02:12:36.277 --> 02:12:38.277
voices to the table. Those who

02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:41.790
were unheard, unseen in

02:12:41.715 --> 02:12:43.715
merchants association actions

02:12:44.818 --> 02:12:46.818
that sfmta did not know existed.

02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:50.389
I want to applaud sfmta and the
mayor's office for bringing

02:12:51.292 --> 02:12:54.227
everyone together in a really,
really safe space and having

02:12:57.131 --> 02:12:59.799
these great conversations. For
those of you who don't know me

02:13:00.134 --> 02:13:02.134
and my work, I have actually

02:13:02.169 --> 02:13:04.237
been with the office of economic
and workforce development for

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.343
over ten years. Open space
activations is at the heart and

02:13:10.378 --> 02:13:13.800
soul of what I do every day.
Besides engaging small

02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:16.150
businesses, many of you have

02:13:16.184 --> 02:13:19.119
been to a lot of my activate
sessions and didn't even know it

02:13:20.188 --> 02:13:22.188
. Hayes valley. That's when your

02:13:23.624 --> 02:13:25.624
work is good. Hayes valley is at

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:27.760
the heart of this is deep to me

02:13:28.463 --> 02:13:30.463
because when I go to hayes

02:13:30.699 --> 02:13:32.699
valley and when I get there, by

02:13:33.201 --> 02:13:36.103
the way, I am a muni person. I
don't have a car. So when I'm

02:13:36.338 --> 02:13:38.338
there and I see that space, I

02:13:38.706 --> 02:13:41.575
want to see it activated. And I
want to see it be brilliant and

02:13:42.610 --> 02:13:44.610
I want it to be the shining star

02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:47.615
of the city. We have work to do
to get it there. And I think

02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:50.550
it's really, really important

02:13:51.253 --> 02:13:54.221
that we say that out loud. We
have work to do to get it to be

02:13:56.124 --> 02:13:58.659
a shining star. And I and I
really, again, want to thank

02:13:58.727 --> 02:14:00.727
monica and her team for

02:14:00.963 --> 02:14:03.665
listening to people. I also want
to point something out because

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.168
I've been here since 1:00 and a
lot of small businesses have

02:14:07.336 --> 02:14:10.380
been here since 1:00. And this
is something for all of us to

02:14:11.206 --> 02:14:13.206
think about. The business that

02:14:13.241 --> 02:14:15.376
are here are sole proprietors.
Some of them MAY have had to

02:14:16.178 --> 02:14:18.178
close their doors to come here

02:14:18.715 --> 02:14:20.715
today, having people go through

02:14:21.417 --> 02:14:23.417
public comment for an item that

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.120
impacts small businesses. Let's

02:14:26.121 --> 02:14:28.289
rethink how we do this and let's
really rethink how we treat our

02:14:29.858 --> 02:14:32.727
small businesses. And again, I
really want to emphasize this

02:14:32.895 --> 02:14:35.797
because it did come up in our
survey. People were afraid to

02:14:35.965 --> 02:14:38.600
come forward and speak about
this closure because they felt

02:14:39.569 --> 02:14:41.569
at times they would be bullied

02:14:42.305 --> 02:14:45.208
or treated unfairly. And so I
want to make sure at the

02:14:45.208 --> 02:14:47.208
conclusion of this, the voices

02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:50.780
from the small businesses that
you hear today, they can walk

02:14:51.313 --> 02:14:53.313
away feeling safe and heard. And

02:14:53.917 --> 02:14:55.917
that's all we ask for. That's

02:14:59.623 --> 02:15:02.357
it. Thank you. Thank you.
Director henzi, I believe you

02:15:05.610 --> 02:15:07.329
had your hand up. I did this
sort of. This is a question for

02:15:07.930 --> 02:15:09.930
monica, but it sort of builds on

02:15:10.934 --> 02:15:12.934
what MISS Thompson just touched

02:15:16.573 --> 02:15:18.573
on. Do we have typically, um,

02:15:22.245 --> 02:15:24.245
evaluate evaluation metrics and

02:15:26.716 --> 02:15:28.716
sort of reporting requirements

02:15:29.530 --> 02:15:31.530
for storm surge spaces, street

02:15:34.591 --> 02:15:36.591
closures. Um, and if we don't,

02:15:37.828 --> 02:15:39.828
um, have you thought of

02:15:42.165 --> 02:15:45.340
evaluation, evaluation metrics
possibly for this one, like the

02:15:46.837 --> 02:15:48.837
number of activations they have,

02:15:49.206 --> 02:15:51.206
the number of, I don't know,

02:15:51.242 --> 02:15:53.242
people that you use it on

02:15:53.410 --> 02:15:55.410
comparing on what days,

02:15:57.114 --> 02:15:59.114
etcetera, and the such. Um so

02:15:59.216 --> 02:16:01.216
could you touch on evaluation of

02:16:01.818 --> 02:16:03.818
the closure as we consider this,

02:16:06.758 --> 02:16:09.492
as we before public comment. Yes
thank you. Director henzi have

02:16:10.194 --> 02:16:12.194
thought about it. I think is a

02:16:12.363 --> 02:16:14.363
wonderful idea in the effort of

02:16:16.233 --> 02:16:18.233
transparency and decision making

02:16:18.502 --> 02:16:20.670
. It is not easy to develop
metrics for something like this.

02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:23.390
How do you it's such like a

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.576
soulful art and sense of being

02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:30.180
sort of can you establish a
number? Is the number of people

02:16:30.948 --> 02:16:33.183
a certain amount then that is a
success? Is it the quality of

02:16:34.385 --> 02:16:36.385
the event and the activation?

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.923
And so I don't say that as an
excuse. I think it is definitely

02:16:38.923 --> 02:16:41.692
something I would like to
explore. We have a lot of

02:16:42.194 --> 02:16:44.995
evaluation programs here at the
sfmta and people that think a

02:16:45.963 --> 02:16:48.333
lot about this and I would love
to consult them and people that

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:50.901
work with small businesses so
that we can establish that. But

02:16:51.869 --> 02:16:53.937
it is we would want to do it
thoughtfully so that we are

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:56.439
right. It is measurable. Yeah,

02:16:57.543 --> 02:16:59.543
it is a hard it is a hard thing

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:06.517
to measure, but yeah. Okay thank
you. Manager. That was it. Okay.

02:17:07.786 --> 02:17:10.321
Thank you. Director henzi
colleagues, I'd like to open it

02:17:10.655 --> 02:17:13.524
to public comment. Unless
there's anything else pressing
right now. Okay. Please.

02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:17.561
Speakers in the room on the

02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:20.131
hayes street. Shared spaces. I
do have some speaker cards.

02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.468
Andrew andrew singer. Jennifer
laszlo barnett. Trzcinski stacy

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.606
randecker. Afternoon board.

02:17:30.144 --> 02:17:32.144
Barnett brzezinski. District two

02:17:33.713 --> 02:17:35.947
frequent visitor of hayes valley
. If I could recap a little bit

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.784
of the presentation we just saw
the closure and the area there

02:17:40.553 --> 02:17:42.954
in hayes valley on hayes street
is so popular for people double

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:47.225
parked to try to get into the
area even more than they already

02:17:47.527 --> 02:17:49.527
can with with legal parking. So

02:17:49.629 --> 02:17:51.629
if there is a moment of peace

02:17:52.432 --> 02:17:54.499
and quiet on the street, aka it
hasn't been activated, that's a

02:17:55.501 --> 02:17:58.303
permit violation because drivers
are behaving badly and violating

02:17:58.938 --> 02:18:00.972
the barricade. We're going to
remove the barricade and let

02:18:03.376 --> 02:18:05.610
them in more. As an example of
what's going on around the city.

02:18:06.446 --> 02:18:08.647
And these are all incidents that
happened in the last week and a

02:18:09.749 --> 02:18:12.484
half. A car drove off the road
and onto a building at filbert

02:18:13.453 --> 02:18:15.587
and fillmore, causing a gas leak
in building damage and making

02:18:15.722 --> 02:18:17.722
the fire department respond. A

02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:19.790
driver committed a hit and run

02:18:20.426 --> 02:18:22.527
in the bayview, hitting a car
which then hit a muni vehicle,

02:18:23.263 --> 02:18:26.980
which I'm sure a lot of you are
aware of. A car recently veered

02:18:26.466 --> 02:18:28.670
off the road on divisadero and
smashed into a bus shelter

02:18:28.869 --> 02:18:31.670
between page and haight, a store
in union square was ramrodded

02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:35.340
so-called by burglars who drive

02:18:35.542 --> 02:18:38.143
a car into the building in order
to then steal from it. And there

02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:41.414
was a 100 mile an hour chase
coming up the peninsula that

02:18:42.249 --> 02:18:45.218
ended right at the freeway exit
where hayes valley begins. This

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:49.155
is the type of thing that we are
inviting onto our streets as a

02:18:50.757 --> 02:18:53.659
default when any other more
higher purpose, pedestrian

02:18:55.996 --> 02:18:57.996
friendly closure, more business

02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.133
activity, more just neighbors
getting to know their neighbors.

02:19:00.134 --> 02:19:02.302
This is considered the
aberration. You have to apply

02:19:03.637 --> 02:19:05.638
for a permit for this. I
strongly encourage you to

02:19:05.939 --> 02:19:07.939
please, please, please consider

02:19:09.643 --> 02:19:11.644
sending this back to the mta in
encouraging them that any

02:19:13.213 --> 02:19:15.815
increase in vehicle lane mile
access is a contravention of

02:19:15.883 --> 02:19:17.883
transit first policy and the

02:19:17.952 --> 02:19:19.952
climate goals the mta has and

02:19:20.254 --> 02:19:22.254
also ask a question why are we

02:19:22.623 --> 02:19:24.624
the only city going backwards on
this nearly every city in the

02:19:26.494 --> 02:19:28.795
bay area and even around the
world in the country is
expanding pedestrian access be

02:19:28.796 --> 02:19:30.830
street in san mateo, castro
street in mountain view. One of

02:19:30.998 --> 02:19:33.801
the speakers earlier mentioned
san jose. So we need to do more

02:19:34.803 --> 02:19:36.803
of this within san francisco.

02:19:38.891 --> 02:19:40.891
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

02:19:40.908 --> 02:19:43.900
Next speaker. Hi I'm jennifer
laska, the PRESIDENT Of the

02:19:43.811 --> 02:19:45.411
hayes valley neighborhood
association. And I pulled the

02:19:46.414 --> 02:19:48.470
original permit three years ago
and have been worked working

02:19:48.716 --> 02:19:50.716
tirelessly with the merchants on

02:19:51.586 --> 02:19:53.721
this as you've heard over and
over again, this closure is very

02:19:53.922 --> 02:19:55.922
beloved by the community. The

02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.726
immediate community. And I hear
from people who say that they

02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:01.862
come from all over the city to
come, come and enjoy this space

02:20:01.863 --> 02:20:03.863
on the weekends. So that brings

02:20:04.465 --> 02:20:06.667
more business to our our small
businesses in hayes valley. I

02:20:07.436 --> 02:20:09.470
want to note that the merchants
actually applied for a three day

02:20:10.806 --> 02:20:13.307
closure. What you're seeing in
front of you is a one day

02:20:13.942 --> 02:20:16.810
closure that was recommended by
sfmta staff. That is not what we

02:20:19.614 --> 02:20:22.830
applied for. We still have not
heard a good reason why a three

02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:24.830
day closure can't continue.

02:20:24.519 --> 02:20:26.519
We've heard issues about the

02:20:26.622 --> 02:20:28.622
barricades. There's a solution

02:20:28.924 --> 02:20:30.924
for that. That's something that

02:20:31.427 --> 02:20:34.950
we totally agree with should be
done. And we've also heard

02:20:34.797 --> 02:20:36.797
difficult days about rerouting

02:20:37.466 --> 02:20:39.466
the bus for three days a week.

02:20:39.735 --> 02:20:41.735
But no one's been able to

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.372
explain to me why that really is
a difficulty. And we've seen it

02:20:44.373 --> 02:20:46.373
done successfully for over a

02:20:46.909 --> 02:20:49.644
year now. So I really need to
understand why that would be a

02:20:49.879 --> 02:20:51.879
barrier to continue ing this

02:20:53.916 --> 02:20:55.916
three day closure. I guess we

02:20:56.285 --> 02:20:58.352
have now heard the concerns of
the fire department, but it

02:20:58.455 --> 02:21:00.721
sounds like the barricade
reconfiguration will help with

02:21:03.326 --> 02:21:05.326
those. And I think the

02:21:05.461 --> 02:21:07.729
additional signage will also
improve some of the traffic

02:21:09.198 --> 02:21:11.499
issues. We'd love to work on
this as a permanent solution

02:21:11.834 --> 02:21:13.834
because there is an easy way to

02:21:15.304 --> 02:21:17.972
have two lanes heading westbound
on hayes turn left onto gough

02:21:18.708 --> 02:21:20.708
and really improve that traffic

02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:23.770
flow full time. So in summary, I

02:21:23.246 --> 02:21:25.246
really urge approving the three

02:21:25.949 --> 02:21:28.490
day closure not just the one day
closure that's in front of you

02:21:28.785 --> 02:21:30.785
today. Thank you. Thank you.

02:21:34.557 --> 02:21:37.393
Next speaker, please. Hi, my
name is andrew signer. I've been

02:21:38.928 --> 02:21:41.197
living in the city for 20 years.
I've been in hayes valley for

02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:44.400
seven at the beginning of the
pandemic, a large group of

02:21:44.434 --> 02:21:46.434
volunteers, myself included,

02:21:47.704 --> 02:21:50.572
spent every friday and saturday
and sunday stationed at

02:21:50.673 --> 02:21:52.673
intersections along the merchant

02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:55.900
corridor to get the shared

02:21:55.212 --> 02:21:57.212
spaces program off the ground.

02:21:57.848 --> 02:22:00.683
Three years later, I believe
it's been a shining example of

02:22:01.918 --> 02:22:04.620
what's enabled our neighborhood
not only to survive the

02:22:05.822 --> 02:22:07.790
pandemic, but but thrive. And
that includes probably our

02:22:09.192 --> 02:22:11.192
busiest time friday night all

02:22:11.762 --> 02:22:14.597
the way through sunday.
recently, the program has been

02:22:14.832 --> 02:22:16.832
the future has been a little bit

02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:19.535
uncertain that was definitely a
wake up call for myself and a

02:22:19.569 --> 02:22:21.604
lot of folks in the
neighborhood. And I created a

02:22:22.390 --> 02:22:24.240
website free hayes.Org along
with the petition asking not

02:22:25.809 --> 02:22:27.809
only to continue the three day

02:22:28.379 --> 02:22:30.647
program but to find a way to get
to a permanent pedestrianized

02:22:33.117 --> 02:22:35.185
hayes street. Since SEPTEMBER,
1200 people have signed it.

02:22:35.553 --> 02:22:37.553
There's enormous enthusiasm

02:22:38.189 --> 02:22:40.990
around this in our community. I
also think there's a lot of

02:22:41.125 --> 02:22:43.125
capacity to help the sponsor

02:22:43.193 --> 02:22:45.963
make this a successful program.
So with that in mind, I have two

02:22:46.931 --> 02:22:48.931
requests for you all. One,

02:22:50.702 --> 02:22:53.403
please amend the agenda item to
allow us to continue this three

02:22:54.305 --> 02:22:56.473
day program that we've had for
three years. And two, please

02:22:58.175 --> 02:23:00.175
instruct mta staff to design a

02:23:01.445 --> 02:23:03.213
process to a what it looks like
to get to a fully pedestrianized

02:23:05.283 --> 02:23:07.785
street. And finally, I just want
to thank you for all your work,

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:11.188
particularly mta staff and folks
in the mayor's office and folks

02:23:11.222 --> 02:23:13.724
in our supervisor's office.
There's tons of work going into

02:23:13.992 --> 02:23:15.992
this, so thank you so much.

02:23:19.464 --> 02:23:21.464
Thank you. Next speaker, please.

02:23:22.133 --> 02:23:24.133
Good afternoon. My name is

02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:28.272
stephen breach and I urge you to
not I urge you to not reduce the

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:31.410
hayes valley shared spaces
program from three days a week

02:23:31.276 --> 02:23:33.276
to just nine hours on saturdays.

02:23:33.545 --> 02:23:36.480
Furthermore I urge you to direct
staff to help the hayes valley
merchant council accommodate the

02:23:36.714 --> 02:23:39.484
owners requirements that are
being placed on them by the fire

02:23:39.985 --> 02:23:42.820
department and the sfmta staff
excuse me, to renew their permit

02:23:43.655 --> 02:23:46.390
and maintain the program. Hayes
valley shared spaces program has

02:23:46.458 --> 02:23:49.600
been an economic lifeline for
merchants on hayes for the past

02:23:49.161 --> 02:23:51.128
three years and has helped
revitalize the entire

02:23:51.329 --> 02:23:54.265
neighborhood by expanding
patricia's green and connecting
it to the local businesses on

02:23:55.101 --> 02:23:57.168
hayes street. Once again, the
fire department is fighting the

02:23:57.703 --> 02:23:59.738
shared spaces program on the
grounds that closing the street

02:24:00.706 --> 02:24:03.408
to vehicles with traffic cones
impedes their emergency response

02:24:04.777 --> 02:24:06.777
times. While I analyze six years

02:24:06.812 --> 02:24:09.130
of vehicle crashes on hayes
street and the fire department's

02:24:09.948 --> 02:24:11.948
response times to 355 emergency

02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:13.950
calls that have been there over

02:24:14.487 --> 02:24:16.588
the past six years. And I found
this at least four of the

02:24:17.356 --> 02:24:19.356
vehicle crashes on hayes street

02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:21.359
on the 3405 hundred blocks could

02:24:21.454 --> 02:24:24.329
have been prevented if the
program was not scaled back in

02:24:25.731 --> 02:24:27.999
2021. An and if it actually had
been extended to 2018 when we

02:24:28.901 --> 02:24:31.570
should have actually started
doing this earlier. Furthermore,

02:24:32.105 --> 02:24:34.339
the shared spaces program has
not had an impact on emergency

02:24:36.242 --> 02:24:38.242
response times by station 36,

02:24:38.277 --> 02:24:40.411
which is three blocks away, and
which services all 911 calls to

02:24:42.114 --> 02:24:44.282
the area. The two minutes is not
enough time to go into the

02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:47.452
specifics, but you should have
received a deluge of emails

02:24:47.821 --> 02:24:49.722
yesterday that link to my data
analysis, which hopefully you've

02:24:50.357 --> 02:24:52.524
had a chance to review and I'm
happy to follow up with any

02:24:52.659 --> 02:24:55.394
answers or any questions you MAY
have. So the takeaway here is

02:24:56.290 --> 02:24:58.630
that the hayes valley shared
spaces program expands a
critical, pro-business, safe,

02:24:59.332 --> 02:25:01.767
open space simply by restricting
unnecessary cut-through traffic
and does not have a negative

02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:04.703
impact on the on the fire
department's emergency response

02:25:05.906 --> 02:25:08.574
times. Furthermore reducing the
program from three days to one

02:25:08.809 --> 02:25:10.809
flies in the face of our city's

02:25:11.111 --> 02:25:13.212
climate action plan, or vision
zero. And our transit first

02:25:13.481 --> 02:25:15.749
goals. Please do not reduce the
footprint of this program and

02:25:15.749 --> 02:25:17.716
direct staff to help the hayes
valley merchant council

02:25:18.618 --> 02:25:20.452
administer and expand it. Thank
you. Thank you for your

02:25:26.794 --> 02:25:28.794
comments. Next speaker, please.

02:25:28.796 --> 02:25:30.796
Hi, maggie. Crystal I own a

02:25:30.897 --> 02:25:33.466
hayes street facing business.
I'm also a resident in hayes

02:25:34.301 --> 02:25:36.301
valley, which means that I can

02:25:36.503 --> 02:25:39.438
actually walk to work. I've been
reflecting this last week on the

02:25:40.608 --> 02:25:42.676
terrible events that we've
probably all been reflecting on,

02:25:44.278 --> 02:25:46.513
and it's a bit ironic that we're
squabbling over a one block

02:25:48.916 --> 02:25:50.916
patch of asphalt. I'm

02:25:51.118 --> 02:25:53.586
supporting. I'm one of the 66%
that supports the modifications

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.880
proposed by sfmta, and I'm super

02:25:58.626 --> 02:26:00.627
hopeful that this reset any
reset will reframe the

02:26:02.463 --> 02:26:04.463
conversation and allow for an

02:26:05.232 --> 02:26:08.340
opportunity for all of us to
participate in a really dynamic

02:26:08.202 --> 02:26:10.202
and wonderful, active version of

02:26:11.672 --> 02:26:13.672
400. Thank you. Thank you. Next

02:26:17.278 --> 02:26:19.278
speaker, please. Hi, stacy

02:26:21.482 --> 02:26:23.482
randecker. This all feels oddly

02:26:23.718 --> 02:26:25.718
familiar to the active

02:26:26.754 --> 02:26:28.754
communities program, the one

02:26:29.924 --> 02:26:31.925
where we are spending a year to
go out and ask people how they

02:26:32.928 --> 02:26:34.928
feel or the valencia pilot where

02:26:35.197 --> 02:26:38.320
we're doing this weird thing and
checking it out to see how

02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:41.535
things go for a year. When are
we going to have the thing that

02:26:43.471 --> 02:26:45.606
is like bold and like is where
we should be going? We're asking

02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.611
people like, we're going to
scale back this thing that's

02:26:50.813 --> 02:26:52.813
awesome and we're going to and

02:26:53.315 --> 02:26:56.250
we have to like, you know,
activate it and do all this
stuff and barriers up and

02:26:56.685 --> 02:26:58.685
barriers down. And it is too

02:27:00.722 --> 02:27:03.591
much. How about 24 over seven
pedestrian ization of three

02:27:04.659 --> 02:27:06.659
blocks? That's your pilot.

02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:09.230
That's the thing. That's what we
all pour our efforts into. So

02:27:09.598 --> 02:27:11.766
all the energy that's going
into, well, what do you think

02:27:12.568 --> 02:27:14.735
and how would this work? And
blah, blah, blah. No actually do

02:27:15.804 --> 02:27:17.772
it. Go there and see what does
the fire department need when we

02:27:18.941 --> 02:27:21.876
set it up this way, what do the
merchants need to get access,

02:27:22.210 --> 02:27:24.210
etcetera? What do the residents

02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:26.448
feel and it shouldn't have to be
this special, like, oh, we've

02:27:27.116 --> 02:27:29.116
got to jazz it up and whatever.

02:27:29.452 --> 02:27:32.320
It's just like the bike to roll
work or school day for
everybody. It's like it

02:27:32.688 --> 02:27:35.423
shouldn't be a special event. It
should be every day that there

02:27:36.325 --> 02:27:38.325
are places you can go that is

02:27:39.261 --> 02:27:41.729
quiet or that you can get a bite
to eat. You can gather with your

02:27:42.266 --> 02:27:44.266
friends. There's extra space

02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:47.340
there is these islands should be

02:27:47.370 --> 02:27:49.938
throughout the city. We should
make it so that everybody can

02:27:51.174 --> 02:27:53.174
get everywhere they need to go

02:27:53.442 --> 02:27:56.177
without relying on a car or more
of this. Please expand this.

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:01.480
Don't contract it. Expand this

02:28:01.118 --> 02:28:03.786
and multiply it. Let's go after
I want clement and 24th street

02:28:05.555 --> 02:28:07.555
to thanks. Thank you for your

02:28:11.461 --> 02:28:13.461
comment. Next speaker, please.

02:28:14.131 --> 02:28:16.131
Good afternoon, director tomlin

02:28:17.601 --> 02:28:20.236
and board. I'm lloyd silverstein
. I'm the founder of the hayes

02:28:20.504 --> 02:28:23.472
valley merchants council and we
currently hold the permit for

02:28:23.773 --> 02:28:26.676
the shared streets program. I
also want to mention I'm a third

02:28:28.377 --> 02:28:30.813
generation owner of the oldest
optical store in san francisco,
which got its start just a few

02:28:31.881 --> 02:28:33.881
blocks from here in 1907. I hope

02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:36.586
you'll indulge me if I go over
my two minutes, but there's been

02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:38.920
a lot going on here and I really

02:28:39.490 --> 02:28:42.325
want to be able to address
everything. Hayes valley was hit
especially hard by the pandemic.

02:28:43.930 --> 02:28:45.428
Within six months, one out of
every three businesses had

02:28:45.662 --> 02:28:48.310
closed for no other commercial
corridor in the city was hit

02:28:48.310 --> 02:28:50.666
this hard. Yet we've come back
faster and stronger than any of

02:28:51.468 --> 02:28:52.969
them. We are fully leased. Take
a look at chestnut union

02:28:54.138 --> 02:28:56.273
fillmore. You'll see dozens of
for lease signs. The reason that

02:28:56.273 --> 02:28:59.900
hayes valley is thriving is
simple. For much of the

02:28:59.109 --> 02:29:01.977
pandemic. I and others that
you've heard from today spent
our weekends touring hayes

02:29:02.479 --> 02:29:04.614
valley with brokers and
potential new tenants. What they

02:29:06.490 --> 02:29:07.583
saw here and what they saw.
Nowhere else was activity.

02:29:08.618 --> 02:29:11.210
People out in the streets, in
our public spaces, in other

02:29:11.155 --> 02:29:13.990
words, customers for our small
businesses. This is just part of

02:29:14.258 --> 02:29:16.393
the value of shared streets. Our
merchants council is democratic

02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:19.940
by nature. We advocate for the

02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:21.131
greater good of all merchants.
We also espouse that our

02:29:21.198 --> 02:29:23.333
neighbors successes and
important as our own and the

02:29:23.968 --> 02:29:26.269
speaking with one loud voice
that represents the majority of

02:29:26.403 --> 02:29:28.806
our businesses is in the best
interests of our community. In

02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:32.900
the case of shared streets, that
voice is loud and clear. Keep

02:29:32.243 --> 02:29:34.243
our existing shared streets

02:29:34.445 --> 02:29:36.647
program. This is not anecdotal.
This is based on our unbiased

02:29:38.282 --> 02:29:41.217
online survey sent to 175
businesses in our community. It
was completely transparent and

02:29:42.486 --> 02:29:44.486
available for all respondents to

02:29:44.523 --> 02:29:46.523
view. I will say for a moment

02:29:47.258 --> 02:29:49.258
here that the one mta conducted

02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:51.460
was biased. It only asked, are

02:29:51.596 --> 02:29:53.831
you in favor of a saturday? Only
it didn't say. Are you in favor

02:29:54.732 --> 02:29:56.732
of friday? Only sunday, only all

02:29:56.801 --> 02:29:59.370
days. So it was very biased and
obviously the results were

02:29:59.370 --> 02:30:02.338
biased to even though we were
told by mta that our survey was

02:30:02.508 --> 02:30:05.243
not necessary, we felt that it
was a way to get accurate census

02:30:05.777 --> 02:30:08.479
on the issue. Our survey was
reviewed by mta and the staff

02:30:09.448 --> 02:30:12.284
before sending in all data, both
raw and summarized, was sent
back to them. The survey showed

02:30:12.284 --> 02:30:14.351
overwhelming support for the
existing schedule and some

02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:16.887
people wanted to extend it. When
our shared streets renewal came

02:30:17.555 --> 02:30:19.656
before the escort in MARCH, we
were surprised to hear that

02:30:19.725 --> 02:30:21.960
there were concerns from sfpd
mta, as well as stakeholders

02:30:22.795 --> 02:30:24.795
outside the sheriff's. Thank you

02:30:25.164 --> 02:30:27.331
for your comments. That is your
time and we have to be equitable

02:30:27.399 --> 02:30:29.967
with all speakers. Thank you for
being here. Next speaker, please

02:30:31.503 --> 02:30:33.503
can I put this in the record for

02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:38.700
anybody to see? Sure. Next

02:30:39.111 --> 02:30:41.111
speaker please go ahead and

02:30:42.448 --> 02:30:45.150
approach the podium. Hi. Hi.
This is my first time. Mike

02:30:46.385 --> 02:30:48.252
gallagher I'm not going to speak
as eloquently as everyone else,

02:30:50.956 --> 02:30:53.791
but I'd like it to remain the
same as it was and hopefully

02:30:54.827 --> 02:30:56.827
close for good. You don't need

02:30:57.597 --> 02:31:00.332
to activate a park. We can look
at a bunch of cities around the

02:31:00.366 --> 02:31:02.366
world that are way ahead of us

02:31:02.969 --> 02:31:04.970
and I guess we always talk about
wanting to be a world class

02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:08.873
city, but it only takes trips
elsewhere to see that it looks

02:31:10.109 --> 02:31:12.109
like we're living 30 years in

02:31:13.213 --> 02:31:15.781
the past and people need to have
more space outside to hang out

02:31:18.118 --> 02:31:20.118
and this is just it's clear that
somebody wants this close

02:31:21.587 --> 02:31:23.421
because as it was tried to be
done behind closed doors, pretty

02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:27.759
sure we know who that is. The
mayor doesn't seem to like this

02:31:29.363 --> 02:31:31.363
stuff. And it's time that we do

02:31:31.631 --> 02:31:33.866
bold things and not just mess
around and make the merchants do

02:31:34.601 --> 02:31:36.601
all this stuff. Just let just

02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:39.405
you know, do your job. Like
build this stuff out like they

02:31:40.507 --> 02:31:42.975
do in dutch cities. I mean, this
is a it's a joke. I've been here

02:31:43.576 --> 02:31:45.576
for over ten years and nothing

02:31:45.912 --> 02:31:48.881
changes. And it's just do
something bold. We saw in the

02:31:49.817 --> 02:31:52.510
pandemic what this city could be
. I mean, when it was so quiet,

02:31:52.819 --> 02:31:54.819
when there was just so much less

02:31:55.288 --> 02:31:57.423
and we got all these great
programs and now every single

02:31:57.423 --> 02:32:00.160
time I look, it's getting scaled
back and scaled back and scaled

02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:02.194
back. We're not growing
anything. We're just scaling,

02:32:02.262 --> 02:32:04.696
scaling, scaling the slow
streets, little chips here like

02:32:05.666 --> 02:32:07.767
you can have through traffic.
All this little, little things

02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:11.971
just chip away at it, chip away
at it so that it doesn't work so

02:32:12.139 --> 02:32:15.700
that it can be stopped. It's
pretty clear that that's what

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.411
people want to happen. That's
all I have to say. Okay. Thanks

02:32:18.946 --> 02:32:20.946
for your comments. Next speaker,

02:32:27.655 --> 02:32:30.223
please. I apologize. It couldn't
be here at one because I was on

02:32:31.492 --> 02:32:33.493
a surgery table. It's very
interesting to hear everything

02:32:35.162 --> 02:32:37.330
today. I I've owned a business
on hayes street for 20 years.

02:32:38.398 --> 02:32:40.398
I've lived on grove street for

02:32:40.501 --> 02:32:42.501
15 years. I am the perfect

02:32:42.537 --> 02:32:45.405
person to represent the fact
that all of these huge successes

02:32:45.873 --> 02:32:47.873
that they're talking about

02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:50.177
aren't successes in any way,
shape or form. The information

02:32:51.178 --> 02:32:53.178
they're based off, including

02:32:53.547 --> 02:32:55.547
lloyd's survey, biased,

02:32:57.585 --> 02:32:59.653
manipulative in the tremendous
victories that you guys are

02:33:01.556 --> 02:33:03.556
saying are nonexistent as far as

02:33:03.725 --> 02:33:05.859
I can see by pure stakeholder,
as the people who've done the

02:33:06.861 --> 02:33:09.563
work, the heavy lifting on hayes
street for the past several

02:33:11.632 --> 02:33:14.601
decades, I want to just say I'm
sitting in here. I just realized

02:33:15.370 --> 02:33:17.370
the politicization of everything

02:33:17.539 --> 02:33:20.740
and there's a necessary evil
called politics. And I see you

02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:24.344
guys working. I have a business
on hayes street, not street, not

02:33:25.413 --> 02:33:27.413
a hayes shared street. My

02:33:28.683 --> 02:33:30.683
business is on a street where

02:33:30.852 --> 02:33:32.852
81% of my customers drive their

02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:35.723
car to that street. It's gotten
incredibly difficult. I

02:33:36.325 --> 02:33:39.227
understand. I can look at what
the city has done to abide by

02:33:40.829 --> 02:33:42.829
the rules of the biking

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:46.320
community. The manipulations

02:33:46.301 --> 02:33:48.569
that's going on. I get it. I'd
like to be a progressive city,

02:33:49.205 --> 02:33:51.172
too, but we're also a city
that's founded on streets that

02:33:52.308 --> 02:33:55.276
the fire trucks have to go down
on. And all of the successes

02:33:55.377 --> 02:33:57.377
that I've been hearing about

02:33:57.379 --> 02:33:59.380
today, I'm going to tell you,
please, they aren't as great as

02:34:00.582 --> 02:34:02.582
you guys think they are. And if

02:34:02.718 --> 02:34:05.586
my business for 81% of the
people I'm sorry, I'm going to

02:34:06.288 --> 02:34:09.157
leave with this with you guys,
70% of the people who come to my

02:34:09.225 --> 02:34:11.225
store visit other stores in

02:34:12.228 --> 02:34:14.228
hayes valley. The congestion in

02:34:14.463 --> 02:34:17.232
on laguna and octavio for the
byproducts of all these things,

02:34:18.367 --> 02:34:20.435
a nightmare. I have traffic jams
where I've never had traffic

02:34:21.537 --> 02:34:23.171
jams before. I have people
honking their cars at all times

02:34:25.575 --> 02:34:27.776
when it never existed. So I
don't even want the word I hate

02:34:30.113 --> 02:34:31.780
the word activation right now. I
apologize. Maybe I'm old school.

02:34:32.749 --> 02:34:35.830
No activation. I'm not with
maggie. I don't agree with the

02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:38.486
one day. Thank you. That's your
time. Thank you very much. Does

02:34:39.255 --> 02:34:41.622
anybody want this like lloyd? I
can leave that for you guys.

02:34:42.759 --> 02:34:45.694
This is a 140 customers who are
real people. I'll go ahead and
leave it. That's fine. Next

02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:48.630
speaker, please. Hi. Good

02:34:49.650 --> 02:34:51.650
afternoon, directors. Zach

02:34:51.868 --> 02:34:54.636
lipton, first, I'll just say I'm
sad to hear the news from

02:34:54.771 --> 02:34:56.772
director uchitelle. Thanks for
all your work here and I know

02:34:58.307 --> 02:35:01.110
this is far from the end of your
efforts to help build the

02:35:01.278 --> 02:35:03.446
thriving and more livable city.
One of those efforts is, of

02:35:03.714 --> 02:35:06.148
course, the side street shared
space. And I'm disappointed with

02:35:06.516 --> 02:35:09.151
this proposal to reduce the
successful and popular shared

02:35:09.953 --> 02:35:12.870
space program. I hope we can
continue the friday through

02:35:13.222 --> 02:35:15.222
sunday shared spaces or at least

02:35:15.492 --> 02:35:17.627
just continue this item for a
bit while these issues continue

02:35:18.395 --> 02:35:21.970
to be worked out. But I don't
just want to focus on the number

02:35:21.932 --> 02:35:24.600
of days I hope the agency can
work more to support the

02:35:24.768 --> 02:35:27.504
merchants in the neighborhood to
make the shared space a success

02:35:27.504 --> 02:35:30.172
and work towards a future
permanent, 24/7. Hayes plaza.

02:35:31.208 --> 02:35:33.843
I'm honestly confused why we're
framing this as a compliance

02:35:34.979 --> 02:35:37.847
with permit terms issue and not
a what do we need to do to help

02:35:38.749 --> 02:35:40.749
make hayes street the best place

02:35:40.751 --> 02:35:43.686
it can be? One hayes street has
been a sewer of double parking

02:35:44.355 --> 02:35:47.323
for decades, so why only now are
we punishing merchants by
curtailing the shared space?

02:35:48.525 --> 02:35:50.760
Because we suddenly expect them
to be responsible for parking

02:35:51.696 --> 02:35:53.730
enforcement? Why do we keep
creating impediments instead of

02:35:55.333 --> 02:35:57.401
building on really one of the
most popular successes of the

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:00.170
last few years? When is the last
time you've ever sat in this

02:36:00.905 --> 02:36:03.673
room and heard a near unanimous
parade of merchants praising an

02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:08.112
mta program anywhere in the city
? This this program has

02:36:08.112 --> 02:36:10.781
near-unanimous support from
merchants on the 400 block of

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:14.952
hayes that are directly affected
. And it's one of our city's
most walkable and transit rich

02:36:15.853 --> 02:36:17.853
commercial areas. And for those

02:36:18.189 --> 02:36:20.423
who need to drive, there's a 600
space mta owned parking garage

02:36:21.492 --> 02:36:23.527
around the corner for everyone.
Obviously, as you've heard, the

02:36:24.695 --> 02:36:26.696
shared space is not perfect, but
instead of retreating, which

02:36:27.766 --> 02:36:29.766
will do nothing to address those

02:36:30.735 --> 02:36:32.870
concerns, we can work harder to
make the shared space work

02:36:34.639 --> 02:36:36.840
better and live up to the values
that we talk so much about.

02:36:37.909 --> 02:36:39.909
Thank you. Thank you. Next

02:36:43.815 --> 02:36:45.815
speaker, please. Hi. Board

02:36:45.918 --> 02:36:47.918
members. Luke bornheimer here. I

02:36:48.587 --> 02:36:51.222
urge you to amend the item today
to keep the three day closure

02:36:53.659 --> 02:36:56.527
intact. It's wildly successful.
It should continue. I also urge

02:36:57.462 --> 02:36:59.630
you to direct staff to work
towards a 24 over seven

02:36:59.931 --> 02:37:02.700
pedestrian ization of this block
of hayes street because it's so

02:37:03.702 --> 02:37:05.702
successful. Many of the concerns

02:37:06.305 --> 02:37:08.105
about the closure have to do
with barricades being moved and

02:37:08.974 --> 02:37:10.974
put back and where they go.

02:37:11.210 --> 02:37:13.911
There's a great solution for
that. We've done it on a car

02:37:15.414 --> 02:37:17.582
free jfk. You make it 24 over
seven and then you can install

02:37:17.716 --> 02:37:20.619
barriers that just stay there
and you can actually engineer

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.121
them, work with the fire
department to make them work

02:37:23.556 --> 02:37:26.191
great. You can also install
furniture, street furniture in

02:37:26.258 --> 02:37:29.270
the street and activate the
street on car free jfk. We don't

02:37:30.963 --> 02:37:33.364
have concerts every day. We have
some furniture out there and

02:37:33.999 --> 02:37:36.934
it's activated by just people
coming. We don't need to throw

02:37:37.937 --> 02:37:39.937
parties on every single car free

02:37:40.573 --> 02:37:42.407
street in the city, every single
day at every single hour. You

02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:45.309
can install furniture tables

02:37:46.512 --> 02:37:48.512
shade just allow people to come

02:37:49.849 --> 02:37:51.849
to the space. So I urge you to

02:37:51.984 --> 02:37:54.754
amend this to make it a three
day closure. But I urge you to

02:37:54.754 --> 02:37:57.689
go further and direct staff to
work towards making it a 24 over

02:37:57.891 --> 02:37:59.891
seven, pile it, whatever we want

02:38:00.593 --> 02:38:03.280
to call it. We should be working
towards that as a city. We know

02:38:03.263 --> 02:38:05.263
the crises we face. We know what

02:38:05.398 --> 02:38:08.300
our policies, our goals say. We
know what we talk about in press

02:38:08.467 --> 02:38:10.467
releases or press conferences is

02:38:10.536 --> 02:38:13.339
we can actually act to fulfill
some of those things that we

02:38:14.374 --> 02:38:16.942
talk about doing right here.
This is a very tangible way to

02:38:21.281 --> 02:38:23.281
do it. Thank you. Thank you.

02:38:24.350 --> 02:38:27.152
Good afternoon. My name is pete
wilson and I am a resident of

02:38:29.523 --> 02:38:32.225
district five western addition
and something somebody said

02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:35.128
earlier today about other
countries really made me think

02:38:35.963 --> 02:38:38.931
because as somebody who lived in
italy, 20 or 30 years ago and

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:42.768
rode my bicycle and was hit
several times on the city

02:38:43.937 --> 02:38:46.705
streets and then went back a
year ago and was just amazed at

02:38:46.874 --> 02:38:49.709
the little lanes that they have
and how what a great job they've

02:38:50.911 --> 02:38:53.120
done. And how much fun it is
visiting places over there where

02:38:55.148 --> 02:38:57.984
you do have city sidewalk
streets, not pedestrian streets.

02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:03.756
And so I definitely would
support that every day. And i
like the people who are saying

02:39:04.425 --> 02:39:07.260
24 over seven, seven days a
week. I would also like to see

02:39:09.730 --> 02:39:12.599
as a somebody who is certified
as a trolley bus operator, I

02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:14.800
would love to see the 21 hayes

02:39:14.969 --> 02:39:16.969
trolley bus going downtown,

02:39:16.971 --> 02:39:19.905
actually going somewhere and
providing for not only the

02:39:21.476 --> 02:39:23.510
tourists. I used to work in the
tourism industry, but for the

02:39:23.911 --> 02:39:26.130
residents and to bring more
people to hayes valley because

02:39:28.616 --> 02:39:30.616
it goes as far as hyde. We'd

02:39:30.618 --> 02:39:32.919
like to see it go all the way
downtown and to say that we need

02:39:34.488 --> 02:39:36.488
diesel busses or electric busses

02:39:36.490 --> 02:39:38.858
to come in on the weekend is not
true. Right now, the 31 balboa

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.264
is going off wires. It could go
all the way to caltrans on

02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:47.234
wires. It drives under the wires
for 1.1 miles, and they're

02:39:47.435 --> 02:39:50.370
electrified wires and they're
choosing not to use them. And

02:39:51.572 --> 02:39:54.441
trolley busses use 30% less
power than a than battery

02:39:55.276 --> 02:39:58.179
busses. Let's remember the
mining of the lithium and all

02:39:59.281 --> 02:40:01.415
that other stuff, folks. So
let's bring back the trolley

02:40:01.984 --> 02:40:04.551
bus. We can use it seven days a
week and there's operators who

02:40:05.153 --> 02:40:07.153
love driving those. And thank

02:40:07.289 --> 02:40:10.900
you for your time. Thank you for
sharing your perspective with

02:40:11.626 --> 02:40:14.194
any other speakers in the room.
Seeing none. Please open the

02:40:15.531 --> 02:40:18.233
remote comment at this time.
We'll move to remote public

02:40:18.233 --> 02:40:21.680
comment not to exceed a total
time of ten minutes. Members of

02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:23.304
the public wishing to comment
should dial star three to enter

02:40:24.106 --> 02:40:26.474
the queue each speaker will have
two minutes. Moderator for

02:40:30.612 --> 02:40:32.612
speaker, good afternoon, this is

02:40:32.815 --> 02:40:34.815
barry taranto. I was surprised

02:40:35.718 --> 02:40:37.718
as well to see that you cut down

02:40:41.557 --> 02:40:43.725
the proposal from 3 to 1 day. I
think hayes valley does need the

02:40:45.561 --> 02:40:48.262
help by having the street
closure for the business, but

02:40:48.597 --> 02:40:51.433
there has to be some mitigation
measures to alleviate some of

02:40:52.935 --> 02:40:54.935
the issues that are created by

02:40:55.171 --> 02:40:57.171
the by that block closure.

02:40:57.306 --> 02:40:59.306
Excuse me. Um, first, you need

02:41:02.812 --> 02:41:04.812
to have enough vacant space for

02:41:04.914 --> 02:41:06.914
our taxis and delivery cars to

02:41:07.684 --> 02:41:09.684
pull over and not block the

02:41:10.153 --> 02:41:12.153
intersection or not block the

02:41:12.388 --> 02:41:14.388
not double parked on golf street

02:41:14.524 --> 02:41:16.524
. You also need to also have

02:41:18.694 --> 02:41:20.694
some space on golf east of the

02:41:20.863 --> 02:41:22.863
intersection, not golf city.

02:41:23.132 --> 02:41:25.132
Hayes so because what happens is

02:41:25.802 --> 02:41:28.704
that light that that left turn
arrow is not long enough and so

02:41:30.373 --> 02:41:32.373
you have cars stacked up at that

02:41:32.642 --> 02:41:35.544
left turn and you have cars
double parked in the right lane.

02:41:35.779 --> 02:41:37.779
So what do you do? You so

02:41:38.347 --> 02:41:40.215
there's a problem there. So I
think it's important to actually

02:41:41.619 --> 02:41:44.587
put up permanent signage saying
on this day during certain hours

02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:47.857
it's a towaway zone. So
therefore, when someone gets

02:41:48.659 --> 02:41:51.427
their car towed because it's a
white zone during that time

02:41:51.461 --> 02:41:53.461
period, then they're not

02:41:53.463 --> 02:41:55.664
surprised. And I think it's
important to enforce it.

02:41:55.932 --> 02:41:57.932
Unfortunately, you don't have

02:42:00.171 --> 02:42:02.772
pco's at night enforcing the no
parking zones. So this is

02:42:04.410 --> 02:42:06.776
something you have to rectify
and maybe make that arrow a

02:42:08.450 --> 02:42:10.450
little bit longer. So that so

02:42:10.347 --> 02:42:12.347
therefore, the cars don't stack

02:42:13.784 --> 02:42:16.752
up to that left lane and so I
think it's important to MAY even

02:42:18.689 --> 02:42:20.689
add another day to this. And the

02:42:20.991 --> 02:42:23.326
last thing is that the grove
street exit from the performing

02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.280
arts garage also creates a

02:42:27.631 --> 02:42:29.631
problem when the symphony or

02:42:30.167 --> 02:42:33.690
another event breaks before your
10:00. Like a lot of the time,

02:42:34.772 --> 02:42:37.307
it ends at 930. Thank you. So
that's another time is up next.

02:42:50.955 --> 02:42:52.955
Speaker.

02:42:53.658 --> 02:42:55.658
Conservatoire minor. One concern

02:42:57.929 --> 02:42:59.929
I have is what access to close

02:43:00.698 --> 02:43:02.698
streets will the aged and

02:43:03.801 --> 02:43:05.801
disabled have now these are long

02:43:07.839 --> 02:43:10.641
these can be long blocks and
physically impaired would have a

02:43:11.509 --> 02:43:13.509
difficult time patronizing

02:43:14.746 --> 02:43:16.746
business. So you really have to

02:43:17.249 --> 02:43:19.249
think it over as far as

02:43:21.286 --> 02:43:23.286
patronage goes aged and disabled

02:43:23.855 --> 02:43:25.855
. Also byproducts services on

02:43:27.526 --> 02:43:29.594
this on this street and you're
actually shutting down your

02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:36.990
revenue and I'm concerned about

02:43:36.335 --> 02:43:38.335
that. Basically about access for

02:43:40.238 --> 02:43:42.238
everyone in the city. And you

02:43:43.274 --> 02:43:45.274
cannot favor one population over

02:43:46.312 --> 02:43:48.312
another. It should be open for

02:43:49.748 --> 02:43:51.850
business for everyone. And
what's going to happen during

02:43:52.751 --> 02:43:55.586
the winter? Oh, it's going to be
great to be in the open air

02:43:56.354 --> 02:43:58.354
during the summer. What about

02:43:58.457 --> 02:44:00.457
the winter when it gets cold? So

02:44:01.270 --> 02:44:03.762
basically businesses might be
freezing themselves out of

02:44:06.799 --> 02:44:08.799
revenue. And I think everyone

02:44:10.970 --> 02:44:13.771
loses in the process. So I think
this over very carefully and

02:44:16.575 --> 02:44:18.575
make accommodations for everyone

02:44:19.679 --> 02:44:22.281
and be flexible to adapt to all,
challenge changes. Thank you.

02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:30.540
Thank you. Next speaker. Good

02:44:30.823 --> 02:44:32.858
afternoon. This is mitch records
with the hayes valley small

02:44:33.726 --> 02:44:35.726
business association and hayes

02:44:35.861 --> 02:44:38.597
valley safe. We want to
underscore that throughout the

02:44:39.166 --> 02:44:42.100
entirety of the street closure
on hayes. We've been advocating

02:44:42.969 --> 02:44:44.969
for a fair and equitable process

02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:47.673
. Our concern has always been
that that process for a program

02:44:47.774 --> 02:44:49.774
that was rolled out as a

02:44:50.944 --> 02:44:52.944
temporary during a pandemic was

02:44:53.379 --> 02:44:55.648
never clearly defined. Now that
we've been part of the process,

02:44:55.983 --> 02:44:57.983
we support the recommendations

02:44:58.185 --> 02:45:00.185
set forth for this pilot by

02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.420
sfmta. We also hope that you

02:45:02.422 --> 02:45:04.990
will not be dissuaded by others
who have been trying to change

02:45:05.692 --> 02:45:07.692
the narrative for an initiative

02:45:08.128 --> 02:45:10.763
that has impacted small business
operators and residents not

02:45:11.966 --> 02:45:14.801
always favorably, who have
spoken up over the last couple

02:45:14.969 --> 02:45:17.300
of years with respect to their
concerns evolving around

02:45:17.905 --> 02:45:19.905
scheduling traffic issues,

02:45:19.907 --> 02:45:21.907
signage and lack of activation.

02:45:22.409 --> 02:45:25.111
The current permit conditions at
face value seemingly try to

02:45:26.312 --> 02:45:28.312
address these. So let's try it

02:45:28.348 --> 02:45:30.851
and reassess. I also want to
express concern about the

02:45:31.486 --> 02:45:34.387
inability of small business
operators to speak up and share

02:45:35.322 --> 02:45:37.423
their stance when it has become
evident that there is another

02:45:38.359 --> 02:45:40.893
agenda being driven here which
has hindered the much needed

02:45:41.628 --> 02:45:44.297
conversations about how to
improve the vision of transit.

02:45:45.299 --> 02:45:47.501
First, in hayes valley, we would
like to see the same synergy

02:45:48.369 --> 02:45:50.369
applied to optimizing the many

02:45:50.872 --> 02:45:53.773
open spaces in hayes valley and
the western addition to try to

02:45:54.342 --> 02:45:56.342
really capitalize on the big

02:45:56.677 --> 02:45:58.878
vision we once had with the
removal of the freeway. As it

02:46:00.447 --> 02:46:02.616
stands now, we have serious
traffic issues. We have serious

02:46:02.616 --> 02:46:04.616
public safety issues, all of

02:46:04.819 --> 02:46:07.354
which we've been advocating for
the last few years. All the

02:46:08.723 --> 02:46:11.391
focus has been on this one.
Block thank you. Thank you. No

02:46:14.595 --> 02:46:17.397
additional callers. Okay
colleagues, the item is before

02:46:18.566 --> 02:46:20.133
you are there, comments,
questions. Director kahina,

02:46:23.171 --> 02:46:26.700
please. Thank you, chair, and
thank you to everyone, all the

02:46:26.942 --> 02:46:29.876
members of the public and the
business community that came out
to give public comment on this

02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:35.449
item. Um colleagues, I do see
this this particular proposal as

02:46:36.384 --> 02:46:38.384
a way to formalize a pandemic

02:46:38.954 --> 02:46:40.954
era program. And that alone has

02:46:40.956 --> 02:46:43.570
tons of growing pains to it,
right? Like we're trying to

02:46:44.328 --> 02:46:46.328
figure out how something where

02:46:46.695 --> 02:46:48.695
the economy was shut down, all

02:46:48.864 --> 02:46:50.998
activities were shut down, was
quite successful for a lot of

02:46:51.967 --> 02:46:54.602
folks. A lifeline for a lot of
folks. And how we can bring that

02:46:55.537 --> 02:46:58.273
back and formalize it with our
new activities with all our
different systems up and

02:46:59.408 --> 02:47:02.210
running. So I know this is going
to feel painful for a lot of

02:47:02.745 --> 02:47:05.679
folks for some time as we figure
out how to make this work. Now

02:47:05.681 --> 02:47:07.681
with everything active again,

02:47:08.183 --> 02:47:10.317
um, I do see the proposal before
us laying the foundation for

02:47:10.485 --> 02:47:12.485
something bold. I don't see it

02:47:13.823 --> 02:47:16.558
closing the door to that and it
gives us about a year to regroup

02:47:16.626 --> 02:47:18.626
and really understand how to

02:47:19.228 --> 02:47:21.963
rightsize a solution here. I'm
really grateful that staff

02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:25.667
worked with the office of small
business. I think that was a

02:47:26.635 --> 02:47:28.635
very smart move, but also a very

02:47:29.471 --> 02:47:32.441
intentional move that I think we
need to do more of in future

02:47:33.276 --> 02:47:35.277
projects as we work in
commercial corridors. I've

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.945
worked with mary anne thompson

02:47:39.148 --> 02:47:41.148
before when I did my work at the

02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:43.484
excelsior action group, and so I

02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:45.853
understand and a lot of the work

02:47:45.955 --> 02:47:48.156
that she does and the integrity
with which she does that work.

02:47:50.227 --> 02:47:52.962
And so I was really grateful to
see that she was part of this

02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:55.997
project and that she was part of
the surveying process and truly

02:47:56.399 --> 02:47:58.767
want to thank monica for all the
work that you've done to

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:02.105
shepherd this this project. I
did have a few clarifying

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:04.105
questions, though, on the

02:48:04.173 --> 02:48:06.173
proposal itself. Um, you

02:48:08.712 --> 02:48:10.712
mentioned that that during the

02:48:11.715 --> 02:48:13.715
three day closure we rerouted

02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:17.919
the 21 right? I wanted to just
get your sense, if there are any

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:20.856
material changes in ridership
during that time, if the closure

02:48:22.958 --> 02:48:25.895
affected ridership on the 21 and
if in this proposal were

02:48:26.497 --> 02:48:28.497
mitigating some of those

02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:31.968
challenges. So a great question.
Director unfortunately, I don't

02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:35.400
know. I don't have that
information readily available,

02:48:35.972 --> 02:48:38.874
but can easily pull that the
metrics and what I heard mostly

02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:42.345
from the working closely with
the transit team were around

02:48:45.115 --> 02:48:47.350
reported passenger confusion
about where to find those bus on

02:48:48.986 --> 02:48:51.721
those three days because for
example friday is 4 to 10 part

02:48:53.657 --> 02:48:55.625
of the day part not and also the
operator some of the operator

02:48:55.759 --> 02:48:57.759
complaints and confusion about

02:48:58.296 --> 02:48:59.996
where they need to be when. But
the ridership number I don't

02:49:01.432 --> 02:49:03.500
have. And so I think as we're
evaluating this permit, that

02:49:03.534 --> 02:49:05.535
would be something I'd
definitely be interested in

02:49:07.605 --> 02:49:09.739
understand more. I anticipate
we're going to see this item

02:49:10.641 --> 02:49:13.409
again in a year's time. So it
would be lovely to have that

02:49:13.444 --> 02:49:15.444
type of information available.

02:49:15.714 --> 02:49:18.382
Um, additionally, getting the
operators perspective to I think

02:49:18.583 --> 02:49:20.583
that would be wonderful to also

02:49:21.619 --> 02:49:24.870
have to understand, you know, is
it has it been easy to navigate

02:49:26.424 --> 02:49:28.424
any changes there? And as it

02:49:28.593 --> 02:49:30.593
pertains to the barricades, you

02:49:31.195 --> 02:49:33.129
know, I've thrown a few
festivals myself. I've thrown a

02:49:33.665 --> 02:49:35.733
few events myself and I've gone
through the process and it's

02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:40.200
quite intensive. And you have

02:49:40.472 --> 02:49:42.139
all these folks there from all
these different departments

02:49:42.974 --> 02:49:45.876
weighing in on on a street
closure for one day. And so I

02:49:47.678 --> 02:49:50.480
imagine we had that sort of
level of inspection for this

02:49:51.516 --> 02:49:53.516
particular for closure in this

02:49:54.119 --> 02:49:56.720
permit process. And I'm so great
that fire was part of this and

02:49:57.722 --> 02:49:59.722
they were part of the equation

02:50:00.459 --> 02:50:02.626
here. Who was responsible for
setting up the barricades? I

02:50:02.661 --> 02:50:05.396
understand we're purchasing the
barricades and we're setting

02:50:06.197 --> 02:50:08.197
that up, which is quite generous

02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:10.935
because it's got permit holders
have to pay that fee themselves

02:50:12.271 --> 02:50:14.438
and they have to pay fees for
all the signage and all that

02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:16.941
stuff. So it seems like we're
we're doing our good faith

02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:19.760
effort and supporting this by

02:50:19.211 --> 02:50:21.312
also doing that. But who is
responsible for setting up those

02:50:22.214 --> 02:50:24.415
barricades? The sponsor for?
Yeah, thank you for asking that.

02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:28.860
To clarify for every shared
space street closure it is the
sponsor the permittees

02:50:29.210 --> 02:50:31.857
responsible city to store and
set up and take down so store

02:50:31.857 --> 02:50:34.659
the barricades throughout the
year they get one set of

02:50:35.761 --> 02:50:38.362
barricades and put them out so
we make sure our job, in

02:50:38.797 --> 02:50:40.898
addition to providing the
barricades, is to educate them.

02:50:41.333 --> 02:50:43.333
We hornbostel our amazing

02:50:44.504 --> 02:50:47.472
engineer is here. He works on
all these renderings and does
this assessment for us. He'll

02:50:47.673 --> 02:50:49.908
draw up the barricade schema,
get on the phone with sponsors,

02:50:51.277 --> 02:50:53.645
talk about them, talk about the
spacing, why we need them. We've

02:50:54.213 --> 02:50:56.348
often gone out in person and
marked up maybe the crosswalk

02:50:57.316 --> 02:51:00.151
for them, but ultimately they
have to set it up every day and

02:51:03.823 --> 02:51:05.823
take it down every day and. If

02:51:06.492 --> 02:51:08.492
this was an issue with a three

02:51:08.528 --> 02:51:10.128
day closure, just wanted to get
a sense from from the team on

02:51:14.333 --> 02:51:16.333
what we're going to do to ensure

02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:19.605
that this is being set up in a
compliant way and how we're

02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:24.750
working with the permit holder

02:51:24.211 --> 02:51:26.211
to ensure that they're compliant

02:51:27.714 --> 02:51:29.714
with that piece. Yeah. Um I

02:51:32.510 --> 02:51:34.152
think like I mentioned, the
education the most we could do

02:51:34.787 --> 02:51:37.256
up front. So there's, there's
this technical information so

02:51:40.339 --> 02:51:42.261
that they understand it. So
there's no discrepancy from the
get go. But ultimately, yeah, we

02:51:43.930 --> 02:51:46.132
don't have bandwidth. We are not
going out every week. We are

02:51:47.501 --> 02:51:49.101
surveying, we are out on the
ground all the time. I've gone

02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:52.771
out there, jared has gone out
there. The fire marshal and

02:51:53.407 --> 02:51:55.308
we'll take photos and we can
like share that back with them.

02:51:56.177 --> 02:51:58.745
Sort of like, hey, this is the
tweak needed. And we don't have

02:51:58.946 --> 02:52:00.946
an official enforcement team at

02:52:01.783 --> 02:52:03.783
the mta to do that. It kind of

02:52:04.451 --> 02:52:06.152
has been on our own time, but I
think that's something else I

02:52:06.887 --> 02:52:09.755
can think of is sort of as
they're rolling it out to be

02:52:09.923 --> 02:52:12.250
kind of monitoring and
reporting, but ultimately,

02:52:12.193 --> 02:52:14.995
again, it is a lot of the
responsibility that these
sponsors are taking on when

02:52:16.397 --> 02:52:18.397
they're applying for a permit.

02:52:20.568 --> 02:52:22.568
And so if in the event the

02:52:24.656 --> 02:52:25.904
permit holder does not comply
with that, what do we do then?

02:52:27.441 --> 02:52:29.810
Or how do we learn about it and
what do we do then? Yeah, this

02:52:30.812 --> 02:52:32.812
is new territory for shared

02:52:32.814 --> 02:52:34.815
spaces because they are
recurring. My understanding for

02:52:35.249 --> 02:52:37.117
escort is special event when
there are compliance issues,

02:52:37.885 --> 02:52:40.200
it's more reflected on when a
sponsor comes back the next

02:52:40.655 --> 02:52:42.989
year. Kind of like maybe are we
permitting them again? So we've

02:52:43.591 --> 02:52:45.591
developed revocation thresholds

02:52:47.962 --> 02:52:50.230
and we can and we will iron that
out more for transparency and

02:52:50.899 --> 02:52:52.899
working with the sponsors. We

02:52:53.368 --> 02:52:55.235
haven't had to use that yet, but
having a documentation of, ah,

02:52:57.972 --> 02:53:00.173
you not closing the street when
you said you could, that's one

02:53:00.208 --> 02:53:03.900
problem, like having I'm
permitted for fridays, but some

02:53:03.245 --> 02:53:05.846
fridays I'm not and some fridays
I am. So having that sort of

02:53:07.449 --> 02:53:09.160
when we will on what grounds and
how we would communicate at

02:53:09.718 --> 02:53:12.519
first communicate verbally and
then you're on. You can be

02:53:14.890 --> 02:53:16.690
revoked. We have the ability as
mta to revoke a permit. So we

02:53:16.924 --> 02:53:18.924
want to make sure that that is

02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:21.796
kind of that process is
documented so we can do that.

02:53:22.131 --> 02:53:24.131
It's just a matter of how and we

02:53:24.199 --> 02:53:26.300
haven't had to do that yet, but
we're still sort of new and

02:53:27.236 --> 02:53:29.337
rolling out the shared spaces
program. We weren't doing much

02:53:29.771 --> 02:53:31.939
of that type of enforcement
during the pandemic as we were

02:53:33.375 --> 02:53:35.375
more lenient. Yeah, I would

02:53:36.770 --> 02:53:38.445
definitely say like as we as we
start formalizing this process

02:53:39.810 --> 02:53:41.249
more, I think it would be
helpful for us to understand

02:53:42.418 --> 02:53:44.586
what what sort of compliance
measures we have and what sort

02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:46.820
of enforcement measures we have.

02:53:47.890 --> 02:53:49.857
So that we could support more
projects like this and make sure

02:53:50.726 --> 02:53:53.661
folks are given the proper
guidance and the tools to

02:53:53.862 --> 02:53:55.862
succeed and see these succeed.

02:53:56.532 --> 02:53:58.532
Right so that's the hope. And

02:53:58.668 --> 02:54:00.668
lastly, this is more for jeff,

02:54:01.504 --> 02:54:03.171
but I did want to acknowledge a
letter that we received from

02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:08.750
supervisor preston's office and

02:54:08.310 --> 02:54:10.310
hoping that you could address

02:54:10.713 --> 02:54:12.914
some of the recommendations that
were in that. And I'll point

02:54:15.180 --> 02:54:17.485
them out. So one of them, I
think, was was already addressed

02:54:18.121 --> 02:54:20.155
by by members of the public. But
also with your presentation,

02:54:22.324 --> 02:54:25.160
monica, of why a restoration of
three day weekend closure to

02:54:26.862 --> 02:54:29.831
private vehicles. It would be
challenging at this point. So I

02:54:29.965 --> 02:54:32.835
think you've addressed that
pretty well. But understanding

02:54:33.937 --> 02:54:35.937
the time sensitive of this

02:54:37.741 --> 02:54:39.741
proposal, there was a request to

02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:42.900
entertain an idea of continuing

02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:44.146
the item until DECEMBER to give
the community an opportunity to

02:54:44.547 --> 02:54:47.115
address outstanding issues. And
so I just want to get a context

02:54:48.185 --> 02:54:50.185
of is there a time sensitivity

02:54:51.555 --> 02:54:53.555
in deciding this now, now and

02:54:54.357 --> 02:54:56.525
have we do we think within a
month's time we would make any

02:54:57.294 --> 02:55:00.129
material changes to the project
at with more outreach and more

02:55:02.899 --> 02:55:05.100
engagement with folks? So. Well,
first of all, the timing issue

02:55:06.871 --> 02:55:09.572
is just that the previous permit
has long since expired. And we

02:55:10.774 --> 02:55:12.909
need to formalize the permit for
a whole variety of reasons,

02:55:15.179 --> 02:55:17.380
including liability. What is
clear from all the engagement

02:55:17.881 --> 02:55:20.820
that we've done is there's near
universal agreement on the

02:55:21.284 --> 02:55:23.284
desired outcome. The only

02:55:23.988 --> 02:55:26.456
question is how do we best get
there? The staff recommendation

02:55:27.258 --> 02:55:30.260
is very clear that the best way
to achieve success, to achieve

02:55:30.661 --> 02:55:32.661
the desired outcome of a

02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:35.630
vibrant, car free, active street

02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:39.670
is to temporarily shrink the

02:55:40.237 --> 02:55:42.372
number of days we work with the
community in order to figure out

02:55:43.574 --> 02:55:45.574
how to one, comply with the

02:55:45.777 --> 02:55:48.545
rules of the permit to figure
out activation and three

02:55:49.447 --> 02:55:51.447
continue engaging with community
and getting support from

02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:54.250
merchants and then expand from
there. Once we're able to

02:55:55.453 --> 02:55:57.453
achieve success. So that's that

02:55:57.454 --> 02:56:00.157
is our primary reason in terms
of the desired outcome. Um,

02:56:01.926 --> 02:56:03.926
staff and supervisor preston's

02:56:04.429 --> 02:56:06.497
office are in agreement and I
think generally what we've heard

02:56:07.365 --> 02:56:09.365
from the community is, is mostly

02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:12.235
agreement about the goal that
we're trying to get to where

02:56:13.137 --> 02:56:15.137
there's disagreement is on how

02:56:16.842 --> 02:56:18.842
to get to the goal and delaying

02:56:19.770 --> 02:56:21.770
this item simply delays our

02:56:21.179 --> 02:56:23.179
ability to work with the

02:56:23.481 --> 02:56:25.649
community to get to the goal.
We've we've heard loud and clear

02:56:26.718 --> 02:56:28.718
the various voices. Thank you,

02:56:30.321 --> 02:56:32.321
jeff. Colleagues, are there

02:56:34.126 --> 02:56:36.126
other questions? Okay, director

02:56:37.696 --> 02:56:39.696
henzi, I see you. Go ahead. Um,

02:56:40.365 --> 02:56:42.365
director kikina actually,

02:56:43.735 --> 02:56:45.735
actually only asked my

02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:48.805
questions. I was curious if
these permits were revocable and

02:56:49.641 --> 02:56:51.641
how we were measuring compliance

02:56:56.480 --> 02:56:58.449
with the, the, the, the, the to
configure them weighing out

02:57:02.821 --> 02:57:04.989
configurations. I did want to
and this is mostly for my

02:57:05.991 --> 02:57:07.991
colleagues I did want to and I

02:57:08.294 --> 02:57:10.294
think maybe director uchitel has

02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:13.630
a proposal that he might want to

02:57:14.667 --> 02:57:16.667
propose as a compromise. I did

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.360
want to say I know director kino

02:57:20.339 --> 02:57:22.339
was mentioning a year, but I

02:57:22.541 --> 02:57:24.541
didn't want to maybe consider

02:57:24.977 --> 02:57:27.780
one, maybe director you could
deal gives his proposal well,

02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:34.119
maybe that we shorten the permit
, permit duration and add some

02:57:35.221 --> 02:57:37.221
evaluation metrics. But I'll let

02:57:39.191 --> 02:57:41.191
director uchitel maybe toss out

02:57:43.263 --> 02:57:45.263
his proposal and then I'll add

02:57:47.233 --> 02:57:49.768
to see what he might have. Yeah
okay. Director uchitel, please.

02:57:52.205 --> 02:57:54.205
I feel like what is the sports

02:57:55.207 --> 02:57:57.207
metaphor? A year? What did you

02:57:58.311 --> 02:58:00.311
give me an alley oop? Okay um,

02:58:02.248 --> 02:58:04.417
clearly not my strong suit. It's
that thing where you pass the

02:58:04.918 --> 02:58:06.918
ball and then the person puts it

02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:11.790
in the. The basket. I'm going to

02:58:12.259 --> 02:58:14.927
keep my comments. Just the hayes
valley and the hayes valley.

02:58:15.928 --> 02:58:18.798
Shared space. Yes, I have spoken
to a lot of merchants on this

02:58:20.834 --> 02:58:23.269
corridor and it's a corridor I'm
very familiar with. And I know

02:58:23.704 --> 02:58:26.500
that this has been really tough.
Monica, also alex sweetened the

02:58:26.606 --> 02:58:28.606
mayor's office. Marianne I think

02:58:28.775 --> 02:58:31.677
my greatest disappointment with
this is that it got to this

02:58:32.612 --> 02:58:34.612
point where it's become so

02:58:37.318 --> 02:58:39.180
divisive and I know a thing or
two about this, this getting

02:58:39.687 --> 02:58:41.755
divisive and it's the hardest
thing too, because like the

02:58:44.258 --> 02:58:46.258
small business is ecosystem of

02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:48.895
owners. Like we're all working
so hard to keep our businesses

02:58:50.797 --> 02:58:52.797
open. And for and honestly, the

02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:55.669
pandemic was a moment where that
really brought us a lot of us

02:58:56.270 --> 02:58:58.270
together to kind of support each

02:58:58.506 --> 02:59:00.506
other. And love each other and

02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:03.800
survive and I've seen in the

02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:05.100
post pandemic period as as we

02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:08.481
try to continue to survive that
unity and that that kind of

02:59:09.516 --> 02:59:12.452
togetherness really starting to
splinter, it makes me sad from a

02:59:13.287 --> 02:59:16.560
very tactical perspective. I
think there should be a

02:59:17.191 --> 02:59:20.270
compromise from just reading
through the survey results that

02:59:21.362 --> 02:59:24.231
we gathered. It seems like a
fair bit of merchants on the

02:59:24.832 --> 02:59:27.367
block like it and merchants on
the either other block don't

02:59:28.103 --> 02:59:30.103
like it so much. Not so

02:59:31.390 --> 02:59:33.390
surprising when we've asked them

02:59:33.410 --> 02:59:35.410
to go from it sounds like about

02:59:35.610 --> 02:59:37.610
30 hours to something like 9 or

02:59:39.214 --> 02:59:41.214
10 hours. I'll tell you what, my

02:59:41.316 --> 02:59:43.316
suggestion is, colleagues, that

02:59:43.851 --> 02:59:45.851
we can talk about, but I'll just

02:59:46.540 --> 02:59:48.589
take a step back and say one of
the fatal flaws I think about

02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:53.829
this on hay street is, is how
temporary it actually feels. And

02:59:53.829 --> 02:59:55.863
we're basically asking
communities to reorient

02:59:57.599 --> 03:00:00.567
themselves around a street in
different ways on a weekly

03:00:01.469 --> 03:00:03.370
basis. So a couple of days a
week you can drive through a

03:00:03.672 --> 03:00:05.874
couple days a week, you can't.
And it actually is really hard

03:00:06.942 --> 03:00:08.809
to build community in a space
that's quite so temporary. So I

03:00:10.145 --> 03:00:13.114
think I understand why other
merchants and folks who are

03:00:14.516 --> 03:00:17.485
getting out of the symphony and
people in around are annoyed and
frustrated and confused. And

03:00:20.575 --> 03:00:22.370
part of it is because, as you
know, our streets are also
community spaces. And when we

03:00:23.459 --> 03:00:26.294
don't have any reliable city of
what they're going to look and

03:00:26.462 --> 03:00:28.462
feel like, it creates a lot of

03:00:29.265 --> 03:00:31.265
frustration. An and so I get

03:00:31.667 --> 03:00:34.268
that. So I do think that if
we're going to start if we're

03:00:34.503 --> 03:00:36.503
going to be closing streets and

03:00:36.538 --> 03:00:38.372
opening them up for businesses
and other uses, we need to

03:00:39.242 --> 03:00:40.876
choose some streets. We do need
to make them permanent. We need

03:00:41.644 --> 03:00:43.879
to actually sfmta and the city
needs to invest in them and make

03:00:44.914 --> 03:00:46.848
them awesome or else they're
just going to be like cones in

03:00:48.384 --> 03:00:51.319
the street and merchants trying
to book deejays and making it
cool, which honestly is not

03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:56.291
really what we're good at. So I
do think we need to pick a lane

03:00:57.227 --> 03:01:00.128
pun intended and we need to try
to show how we can make a couple

03:01:01.130 --> 03:01:03.130
of these spaces really special.

03:01:03.433 --> 03:01:06.134
Well, and putting cones up a
couple times a week is not going

03:01:07.169 --> 03:01:09.971
to cut it. So I think we should
meet in the middle for my

03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:12.607
understanding, they had a friday
night closure an all day

03:01:13.644 --> 03:01:15.845
saturday, and all day sunday. I
know it's inconven decent for

03:01:16.847 --> 03:01:19.582
our busses, but I think we
should bring back friday night,

03:01:20.984 --> 03:01:23.719
which is like five hours. That's
15 hours. They used to have 30.

03:01:24.387 --> 03:01:26.823
To me, it seems like a fair
compromise to kind of meet them

03:01:28.324 --> 03:01:30.859
in the middle. I also think that
we should study what would it

03:01:31.862 --> 03:01:33.862
would take, how much money it

03:01:34.398 --> 03:01:36.499
would take, how much time it
would take and how our agency

03:01:37.801 --> 03:01:39.801
could take this one block back

03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:42.705
street and make it something
different than what it is now,

03:01:42.773 --> 03:01:44.773
and work with the fire

03:01:45.375 --> 03:01:47.243
department to think about a
solution that feels good with

03:01:47.645 --> 03:01:50.280
everyone. So I think we should
put our money where our mouth is

03:01:51.282 --> 03:01:53.449
. Study what it would be like to
make one block of hay street

03:01:54.451 --> 03:01:56.451
into a permanent pedestrianized

03:01:56.620 --> 03:01:59.488
space. And I think we should add
back friday night and take away

03:01:59.957 --> 03:02:01.957
sunday night in terms of the

03:02:01.992 --> 03:02:03.992
timing of the permit for this, I

03:02:06.364 --> 03:02:09.660
think it's a very I can imagine
for hayes valley, for any

03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:11.701
merchants association, it's a
lot to go through the approval

03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:15.805
process for this. So I wouldn't
actually advocate for reducing
the time of the permit. But I do

03:02:16.707 --> 03:02:19.443
think and I'm sure, monica,
you'll be in communication with

03:02:19.443 --> 03:02:21.443
them where the kind of checking

03:02:21.611 --> 03:02:24.114
in on how things are going. We
shouldn't wait a year to do

03:02:24.215 --> 03:02:26.149
that, right? We should be
checking in with them more

03:02:26.618 --> 03:02:28.618
regularly and trying to be a

03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:30.754
partner to them. In terms of how
it's actually going and how we

03:02:32.457 --> 03:02:34.900
can be helpful. So that's my
proposal. It seems fair, kind of

03:02:35.126 --> 03:02:37.460
meet them in the middle. I've
heard that friday night was very

03:02:38.562 --> 03:02:40.129
good for them from a small
business perspective. As we

03:02:40.699 --> 03:02:43.534
know, friday nights is a
different vibe than weekend

03:02:43.902 --> 03:02:46.804
days. It brings out different
kinds of folks and there's a lot

03:02:46.971 --> 03:02:48.971
of restaurants in and around

03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:54.510
this block. I'll second that. I

03:02:54.779 --> 03:02:56.779
I was going to suggest six

03:02:57.480 --> 03:02:59.480
months, but directory you could

03:02:59.251 --> 03:03:01.251
tell obviously has much, much

03:03:02.321 --> 03:03:05.256
more background on what it takes
to secure one of these permits.

03:03:10.829 --> 03:03:12.829
So I'm happy with the year. As

03:03:13.698 --> 03:03:15.698
long as that maybe in a memo to

03:03:17.436 --> 03:03:20.238
us you know something back to us
via memo in about six months

03:03:22.474 --> 03:03:24.474
just sort of check in on on on

03:03:27.812 --> 03:03:29.812
how things are going okay say

03:03:31.616 --> 03:03:34.386
something here. Um, I really
like this idea, but then I also

03:03:36.188 --> 03:03:38.188
think that this is this is the

03:03:38.257 --> 03:03:40.458
first time I actually got to see
the small businesses

03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:43.160
representation and also the fire

03:03:43.895 --> 03:03:45.895
department representation here

03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:50.400
in my, my in my tenure working

03:03:50.403 --> 03:03:52.403
or volunteering at city hall. It

03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:55.720
really shows shows that there's

03:03:55.474 --> 03:03:57.275
also a gentleman actually just
got out of the operation desk

03:03:58.210 --> 03:04:00.210
and just to show up. These folks

03:04:01.147 --> 03:04:03.815
do have I'm myself a small
business. I understand like

03:04:07.219 --> 03:04:09.219
every second count and you make

03:04:09.823 --> 03:04:12.758
your choice. Why you are aware
or you are that day to spend

03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:15.760
your 24 hours and really

03:04:15.828 --> 03:04:17.828
appreciate the study. And then

03:04:18.564 --> 03:04:21.533
this is not about not wanting
share streets or not wanting

03:04:23.569 --> 03:04:25.838
climate, you know, saving the
world, saving the earth. You

03:04:27.641 --> 03:04:29.975
know, we are all in the same
focus here. We want this. We

03:04:32.612 --> 03:04:34.612
want all these amazing things on

03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:37.416
our street. This is about about,
in my understanding, hearing

03:04:38.785 --> 03:04:40.785
from all sides. I'm also really

03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:43.220
aware of that. The side that

03:04:44.191 --> 03:04:46.191
actually has lesser voice are

03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:48.961
the one that actually drown ing.
They can't. When you drown, you

03:04:50.163 --> 03:04:52.163
can't even speak. So it is

03:04:52.432 --> 03:04:54.432
really about the when we're

03:04:55.735 --> 03:04:57.735
getting into the pandemic, it is

03:04:58.471 --> 03:05:00.706
what I seen is like we all have
to improvise and just do

03:05:01.675 --> 03:05:03.675
something where to get everyone

03:05:03.677 --> 03:05:05.677
happier and make things happen

03:05:06.800 --> 03:05:08.800
when normally we actually would

03:05:08.415 --> 03:05:10.983
do something a little bit more
and try to figure out a plan and

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:13.953
a policy and accountability and
how we actually enforce certain

03:05:15.455 --> 03:05:17.455
situation and if that actually

03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:23.196
has had life and safety hazard
or concern. Right? So but we

03:05:23.864 --> 03:05:25.865
don't we don't have the luxury
back then. We didn't do that.

03:05:27.535 --> 03:05:29.535
And this is a really great time

03:05:30.604 --> 03:05:32.905
to learn. And how to adapt and
different neighborhood is

03:05:32.973 --> 03:05:35.441
different because the dynamic is
different. So I really

03:05:38.580 --> 03:05:40.580
appreciate the our staff also

03:05:40.782 --> 03:05:42.849
know the fire department, the
small businesses, and also our

03:05:44.352 --> 03:05:46.352
mayor's office really reach out

03:05:48.556 --> 03:05:50.230
to talk to everyone on not just
the few representation

03:05:52.561 --> 03:05:54.662
representative of I'm really
aware of the people that

03:05:55.563 --> 03:05:58.465
actually has less of a voice.
And I really want to give them

03:06:00.635 --> 03:06:02.635
the equal opportunity to live

03:06:03.237 --> 03:06:05.237
peacefully the way they want to

03:06:09.945 --> 03:06:11.945
live. So I wanted to know if on

03:06:13.615 --> 03:06:16.416
friday evening is there more
likelihood that the fire truck

03:06:19.154 --> 03:06:21.154
needed the access to these zones

03:06:21.489 --> 03:06:23.590
? Because I kind of remember
those nights where things are a

03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:27.590
little bit more colorful in our

03:06:28.697 --> 03:06:30.697
city. I mean, if, if that's not

03:06:32.835 --> 03:06:34.835
really if that if that number

03:06:35.136 --> 03:06:37.136
data is not available right now.

03:06:39.574 --> 03:06:42.420
Um I don't I don't know how am I
able to justify doing the friday

03:06:43.211 --> 03:06:45.880
night. Right. But my
understanding from what we heard

03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:49.817
was that the new, the, the point
of the new design, even when it

03:06:50.653 --> 03:06:52.754
is in effect on saturday, is
that we can accommodate fire

03:06:53.989 --> 03:06:55.957
access, is that the fire
department was at the table and

03:06:56.240 --> 03:06:58.659
has worked through this,
approved design. Correct. But

03:06:59.494 --> 03:07:01.996
but my thing is here I'm seeing
this line saying the reason of

03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:05.867
challenges is lack of activation
. And then point two is

03:07:06.369 --> 03:07:09.304
inconsistently meeting permit
conditions such as barricade

03:07:09.839 --> 03:07:11.839
placement and monitoring

03:07:12.475 --> 03:07:14.475
intersections. So when folks got

03:07:15.244 --> 03:07:17.211
the notice of violation in the
building department is because

03:07:19.783 --> 03:07:21.917
once people got the permit and
they violated what they agreed

03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:26.288
to do under that permit, so I'm
just using the similar

03:07:27.690 --> 03:07:29.690
application on policy on permit

03:07:31.427 --> 03:07:33.427
holder and how we can help each

03:07:33.696 --> 03:07:35.696
other out to make our city safer

03:07:39.503 --> 03:07:42.438
and better for everyone. So
yeah, I mean, I would just say

03:07:42.672 --> 03:07:44.841
to mike, to the friday night
compromise, it sounds like if

03:07:44.841 --> 03:07:47.476
we're coming up with barricade
placement that ameliorate some

03:07:49.450 --> 03:07:51.113
of fire department's concerns
about folks double parking in

03:07:52.849 --> 03:07:55.830
the intersection, then that's
going to be the new barricade

03:07:56.687 --> 03:07:59.188
placement. So we'll see if that
actually works or not. And
adding friday night maybe just

03:08:00.390 --> 03:08:02.390
gives more potential opportunity

03:08:02.426 --> 03:08:05.260
for double parking, but we'll
know if it works right? If it if

03:08:05.762 --> 03:08:07.762
the kind of curve works or not

03:08:09.265 --> 03:08:11.265
in terms of activation like I

03:08:12.350 --> 03:08:14.350
think the importance is like

03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:16.710
when are people coming to this

03:08:16.673 --> 03:08:19.509
area and they're going to want
to sit outside and enjoy
themselves. And I think the

03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:22.411
public commenter who said like
like making people do like, like

03:08:23.247 --> 03:08:25.414
the irish jig in the middle of
the street is not how we're

03:08:26.450 --> 03:08:29.251
going to make these places cool.
it's by putting adirondack
chairs and umbrellas and like

03:08:32.337 --> 03:08:33.727
just like letting human beings
be human beings. And I don't
know how we're defining

03:08:34.525 --> 03:08:36.426
activation, but I don't think we
should be defining it as like,

03:08:37.261 --> 03:08:39.261
like number of attendees who've

03:08:39.296 --> 03:08:42.231
signed up to a flash mob on
eventbrite. Okay, I agree. I

03:08:42.299 --> 03:08:45.168
think the example of the
adirondack I love that. Just to

03:08:45.369 --> 03:08:47.436
jump in, director, I agree that
we would define that as

03:08:48.439 --> 03:08:50.740
activation. It doesn't have to
be some live event. People using

03:08:50.908 --> 03:08:53.244
the space and activating the
space. And I hope supervisor

03:08:53.244 --> 03:08:55.645
preston's office, if they're
listening like maybe you can

03:08:55.746 --> 03:08:58.114
provide some funding for this
neighborhood to buy some

03:08:58.182 --> 03:09:00.984
adirondack chairs and some
umbrellas and some furniture to

03:09:02.386 --> 03:09:04.220
like make it interesting. And
maybe you could also help the

03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:07.460
merchants find a place to store
these things, maybe also helping

03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:10.760
them to train folks that they

03:09:10.795 --> 03:09:13.630
can actually monitor and better
with the barricade placements

03:09:15.330 --> 03:09:17.330
and monitoring intersections is

03:09:18.436 --> 03:09:21.404
so and these are all things that
we're eager to do, but we're

03:09:22.841 --> 03:09:25.609
currently not staffed to do. We
are eager to develop a strategy

03:09:25.777 --> 03:09:27.777
for helping make sure that these

03:09:28.146 --> 03:09:30.180
activations are successful. But
that's currently not within our

03:09:31.616 --> 03:09:33.616
means. I also just need to point

03:09:34.652 --> 03:09:36.553
out that that changing the
recommendation to include

03:09:37.956 --> 03:09:40.290
fridays will require that we
restart the entire process,

03:09:41.326 --> 03:09:43.494
including forcing the community
to go back through the task

03:09:45.297 --> 03:09:47.297
process and it loses about a at

03:09:47.399 --> 03:09:50.670
least a month of staff time that
would require we halt progress

03:09:50.680 --> 03:09:52.680
on other street activations

03:09:52.537 --> 03:09:55.205
while we redo this process. So
just for your consideration, as

03:09:55.573 --> 03:09:57.573
you think about what today's

03:09:58.770 --> 03:10:00.178
action wait a second, haven't
they they've applied for a three

03:10:01.614 --> 03:10:03.614
day permit. You we came back to

03:10:03.816 --> 03:10:06.170
them and said we think it should
be one day. We've hauled them

03:10:07.352 --> 03:10:09.352
out to the mta board for us to

03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:12.290
presumably flush this out and we
can't go back to them and say,

03:10:13.692 --> 03:10:15.794
as the mta board, we think you
applied for three days, we'll

03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:19.731
give you a day and a half. So
deputy city attorney susan susan

03:10:19.966 --> 03:10:22.801
cleveland-knowles MAY speak to
it, but why would you bring this

03:10:23.836 --> 03:10:25.836
to us to, like discuss

03:10:26.105 --> 03:10:28.939
directors? Deputy city attorney
susan cleveland-knowles so at

03:10:31.978 --> 03:10:33.978
least for this hearing, you can

03:10:35.981 --> 03:10:38.884
act today, day on director
teal's motion, which would amend

03:10:38.951 --> 03:10:40.951
the resolution that's in front

03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:43.555
of you. But we would recommend
you vote at your next meeting

03:10:44.256 --> 03:10:46.256
because what was noticed on your

03:10:46.559 --> 03:10:48.559
agenda for today was a one day

03:10:49.328 --> 03:10:51.328
closure. It was a little

03:10:51.665 --> 03:10:53.665
interesting notice, but it was

03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:56.535
just for the one day. So we'd be
expanding it to a day and a half

03:10:57.570 --> 03:10:59.871
. MAY I have just let me I'll
let you finish and. Sorry,

03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:02.474
director. So let me just finish
on the task. Notice that I do

03:11:03.109 --> 03:11:06.110
not have that in front of me. I
don't know if it was the

03:11:06.345 --> 03:11:08.345
application and everyone

03:11:08.438 --> 03:11:10.438
discussed all of the issues with

03:11:10.984 --> 03:11:13.218
one, two and three days. If
that's the case, it MAY not need

03:11:14.888 --> 03:11:16.888
to go back to task, but I can't

03:11:17.958 --> 03:11:19.858
know that sitting here unless
this MISS Moonwatch understands

03:11:21.728 --> 03:11:23.728
how that process worked. And

03:11:24.732 --> 03:11:26.732
apologies, director. So for it

03:11:27.868 --> 03:11:29.868
did go to escott in MARCH for

03:11:30.370 --> 03:11:32.205
three days there was no action
taken, but at least that that

03:11:32.806 --> 03:11:35.474
was a step taken with the
original application. Three days

03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:39.144
there was not consensus, so we
weren't able to sort of approve

03:11:40.682 --> 03:11:42.916
or deny at that time. So I don't
know if that would facilitate

03:11:44.418 --> 03:11:47.120
that requirement or another
action step would be the likely

03:11:48.589 --> 03:11:50.589
need to cut frequency on the 21

03:11:50.691 --> 03:11:53.559
days, because friday night is
when the bus is experiencing the

03:11:54.394 --> 03:11:56.394
most delay. As a result from the

03:11:56.597 --> 03:11:58.597
friday evening commute,

03:11:58.932 --> 03:12:00.932
congestion on the reroute. So

03:12:02.102 --> 03:12:04.639
I'm going to jump in here. Okay,
director. So director tilghman,

03:12:04.639 --> 03:12:07.474
you said something very
important, and I think it really

03:12:08.175 --> 03:12:10.175
needs to be sort of fleshed out

03:12:10.544 --> 03:12:13.413
and explained a little bit more.
You said there is near universal
agreement between sfmta staff

03:12:14.181 --> 03:12:16.181
supervisor preston, the

03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:18.385
merchants, the community on what
is the ultimate outcome. So I

03:12:18.653 --> 03:12:21.588
think it's really important for
everybody here to hear you say

03:12:23.157 --> 03:12:25.157
what is that ultimate outcome in

03:12:25.526 --> 03:12:28.228
kind of specific terms so that
we actually know what we're
talking about. Could you

03:12:28.362 --> 03:12:31.197
elaborate on that statement a
little bit more? Sure. I mean,

03:12:31.399 --> 03:12:33.399
the outcome is a space that

03:12:33.467 --> 03:12:35.467
fosters in enjoyment and

03:12:36.171 --> 03:12:38.672
commercial success. It is a
space that's vibrant, that feels

03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:42.109
safe for people of all ages and
abilities that supports the

03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:44.946
merchants success while
accommodating the merchant

03:12:44.946 --> 03:12:46.946
functionality like curbside

03:12:47.315 --> 03:12:50.150
pickup and drop off somewhere.
Right I mean, we've we've seen

03:12:50.218 --> 03:12:52.385
these streets all over the
world. We love them. We're

03:12:53.155 --> 03:12:55.422
capable of delivering them here
in san francisco. But success

03:12:56.592 --> 03:12:59.427
for these streets follows a very
specific set of requirements.

03:13:00.762 --> 03:13:03.731
when we look at such successful
spaces around the world. And so

03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:07.568
one of the key things that we're
working on trying to develop is,

03:13:08.670 --> 03:13:10.670
is what is that entity that

03:13:12.174 --> 03:13:14.174
fosters the activation? So can

03:13:14.276 --> 03:13:17.144
we work with a nonprofit
organization to have commercial

03:13:18.514 --> 03:13:21.382
activation in a box and a sort
of nonprofit that can receive

03:13:22.884 --> 03:13:25.119
private funds and can staff up
around a certain amount of

03:13:25.954 --> 03:13:27.954
expertise where the sfmta is

03:13:28.457 --> 03:13:30.925
role is, is making sure that the
functional needs are taken care

03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:33.928
of and that the safety
requirements are met for all

03:13:34.997 --> 03:13:36.965
emergency services as well as
for traffic safety, as well as

03:13:37.966 --> 03:13:40.735
to the extent that it's
appropriate, funneling public

03:13:41.670 --> 03:13:44.205
money that can be then combined
with private money in order to

03:13:45.375 --> 03:13:48.430
create barcelona or paris or,
you know, antigua, you know,

03:13:49.479 --> 03:13:51.479
where where wherever it is that

03:13:52.615 --> 03:13:54.615
you love. MAY I? MAY I? Yeah

03:13:56.585 --> 03:13:58.853
yeah. MAY I? I don't want to
forgot my thought after being

03:13:59.922 --> 03:14:01.922
interrupted, but I thought the

03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:04.993
idea. So if. If a call is
entertained, my idea. If we

03:14:05.962 --> 03:14:07.962
approve what the staff

03:14:07.964 --> 03:14:09.964
recommended today with the

03:14:12.101 --> 03:14:14.101
condition to monitor the if the

03:14:14.437 --> 03:14:16.437
operators of the merchants

03:14:17.873 --> 03:14:19.873
actually do work collaboratively

03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:23.345
to address these challenges that
have been listed in here, they

03:14:28.584 --> 03:14:30.584
could come back within this year

03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:34.880
period of time to request for a

03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:36.190
longer duration of street

03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:40.229
closure. Yes, that's actually
exactly what we're trying to set

03:14:41.298 --> 03:14:43.899
up by consolidating two
saturdays and investing in

03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:47.200
success. We're eager to not only

03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:49.171
allow, but actually encourage
the merchants to expand just as

03:14:50.540 --> 03:14:53.141
quickly as they're ready. So
that's an unfriendly amendment

03:14:54.143 --> 03:14:56.143
to my motion. I want to advocate

03:14:56.480 --> 03:14:59.249
for adding friday nights back,
because it's been made clear to

03:14:59.350 --> 03:15:01.685
me from the merchants that
friday nights was a very

03:15:01.685 --> 03:15:03.886
successful evening for them. And
so if we're trying to emulate

03:15:04.621 --> 03:15:07.323
what a successful street closure
feels like in this block, having

03:15:08.492 --> 03:15:10.960
them continue to have a portion
of it, we're talking about five

03:15:11.161 --> 03:15:13.396
hours where lots of people were
already coming to this

03:15:14.231 --> 03:15:16.766
neighborhood, giving them an
opportunity to try it out on a

03:15:16.934 --> 03:15:18.934
friday night. And a saturday,

03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:21.771
which is a reduction by 50% of
what they had. So it's still

03:15:21.939 --> 03:15:23.939
cutting it in half. Seems to me

03:15:24.141 --> 03:15:26.141
like a fair compromise. And but

03:15:26.343 --> 03:15:29.178
I agree, giving them this
opportunity, letting them

03:15:30.448 --> 03:15:32.448
activate it, giving them a

03:15:32.783 --> 03:15:35.485
little bit more time because it
sounds like some of the
merchants want it gone. Some

03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:38.955
want it all the way to three
days. We've asked them to go to

03:15:39.524 --> 03:15:41.892
nine hours. It's just giving
them a little bit more time to

03:15:41.892 --> 03:15:43.892
figure this out on friday

03:15:48.266 --> 03:15:50.501
nights. And. Yeah, I think it's
no one's going to be happy with

03:15:51.369 --> 03:15:53.337
there's no one's going to be
happy with everything that comes

03:15:54.205 --> 03:15:56.706
out of this. I'm just trying to
figure out a way to give that,

03:15:56.941 --> 03:15:58.941
to give them a little bit more.

03:15:58.943 --> 03:16:00.943
Yeah I acknowledge your intent

03:16:01.412 --> 03:16:03.546
and I'm trying to work around.
So then also our agency doesn't

03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:06.480
cause another month of payroll

03:16:06.485 --> 03:16:08.953
to go back into the drawing
board and come back again. I

03:16:10.288 --> 03:16:12.122
mean, you know, so then we
approve it now so they can

03:16:12.824 --> 03:16:15.693
actually start trying this out.
And the merchants will really

03:16:17.495 --> 03:16:19.430
start to operate it in the way
that the permit is intended for

03:16:20.965 --> 03:16:22.965
them to do, and then they can

03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:25.200
come back and then add that

03:16:25.738 --> 03:16:27.738
those hours back. Director

03:16:31.443 --> 03:16:33.711
henderson, you want to weigh in.
I'm really I have a question for

03:16:33.879 --> 03:16:35.980
the city attorney, because I
didn't understand the order of

03:16:37.882 --> 03:16:39.882
operations that you laid out. So

03:16:40.653 --> 03:16:42.653
if we I hear the amendment or.

03:16:42.788 --> 03:16:44.788
Yeah, right now I hear there's

03:16:45.591 --> 03:16:47.727
it's too it's too I want to add
friday night and I want us to

03:16:47.727 --> 03:16:49.727
study making it permanent, how

03:16:50.295 --> 03:16:53.970
much it would cost, what it
would look like. Okay and so
that's different than my

03:16:54.333 --> 03:16:57.134
recommendation is approve it
right now and let's with the
condition of monitoring the

03:16:59.639 --> 03:17:01.639
merchants operation now and then

03:17:01.807 --> 03:17:03.808
giving them an opportunity to
extend the operational hours

03:17:05.211 --> 03:17:07.211
within this year of the permit.

03:17:08.347 --> 03:17:10.348
So then we can policy. Why
administrative, why we can

03:17:10.816 --> 03:17:12.816
actually proceed according to

03:17:13.352 --> 03:17:15.323
the timeline and we don't have
to wait another 30 days of

03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:19.560
moniker and the rest of the

03:17:19.859 --> 03:17:21.859
team's time. But but what's on

03:17:22.595 --> 03:17:24.595
the agenda today or how to, I

03:17:24.664 --> 03:17:27.650
guess I'm trying to figure out
like whatever the vote is today.

03:17:27.233 --> 03:17:29.935
I heard you say something then
could occur in a month. And so

03:17:32.906 --> 03:17:34.906
what? So, yeah, let me so first

03:17:35.208 --> 03:17:37.208
of all, director, sir, was that

03:17:37.877 --> 03:17:39.711
a motion that you were making a
recommendation of the. Yeah as a

03:17:40.313 --> 03:17:42.313
motion that I recommend. Okay.

03:17:43.716 --> 03:17:45.716
To work around with everybody.

03:17:45.818 --> 03:17:48.653
The, the, the, the, the
circumstances we have and with

03:17:49.823 --> 03:17:51.823
the fiscal responsibility that

03:17:51.959 --> 03:17:53.959
we have as an agency and also

03:17:54.361 --> 03:17:56.361
the yearning for the merchants

03:17:57.697 --> 03:17:59.697
that director to share with us

03:18:01.701 --> 03:18:03.701
and also seeing on the our staff

03:18:05.738 --> 03:18:07.738
and also the small businesses.

03:18:08.175 --> 03:18:10.343
and also can I do a hybrid fire
department? Can I do a hybrid

03:18:11.979 --> 03:18:14.113
motion of these two? I just
hoping to capture the best of

03:18:15.716 --> 03:18:17.349
both to clarify what what did we
actually henderson's? Yeah, let

03:18:17.884 --> 03:18:20.820
me just reply to director
henderson's the, the reason I

03:18:25.826 --> 03:18:28.461
asked is if. If director feels
motion which has a second by

03:18:30.965 --> 03:18:32.965
director hensey is voted on

03:18:34.335 --> 03:18:37.360
today, it would be a motion to
amend what's in front of you

03:18:38.138 --> 03:18:40.138
today to add it to a day and a

03:18:41.543 --> 03:18:44.511
half based on what MISS Munich
said, it sounds like it was

03:18:45.913 --> 03:18:47.913
noticed at escott for three

03:18:48.148 --> 03:18:50.984
days, in which case I do not
think it would need to go back

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:54.821
to escott. It would just come
back to you here at your next

03:18:56.457 --> 03:18:58.457
meeting for a vote with the

03:18:59.427 --> 03:19:01.427
notice for fridays and saturday,

03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:07.400
and I'll be watching. Oh if

03:19:07.635 --> 03:19:09.635
director sos motion is seconded

03:19:10.605 --> 03:19:12.605
and approved, she does not have

03:19:12.673 --> 03:19:15.376
a second at this point. But if
she does have a second and it's

03:19:15.376 --> 03:19:17.979
approved, it would become
effective. You would vote on it

03:19:18.146 --> 03:19:20.146
and it would you wouldn't do

03:19:21.883 --> 03:19:24.510
anything else except vote today.
It would not come back to you

03:19:25.530 --> 03:19:27.530
have I answered your question?

03:19:29.924 --> 03:19:32.626
Yes okay. Thank you. If there is
a third motion, it looks like we

03:19:32.827 --> 03:19:34.928
got a supervisor in the room
from the chair. Then we would

03:19:36.331 --> 03:19:38.331
need to discuss that. Okay. I am

03:19:38.333 --> 03:19:40.501
going to make a third motion,
but supervisor preston, would

03:19:42.638 --> 03:19:44.638
you like to address the board?

03:19:45.841 --> 03:19:47.908
Thank you very much. Usually I
don't have the pleasure because

03:19:48.777 --> 03:19:50.777
our board meetings are going at

03:19:50.912 --> 03:19:52.981
the same time as yours. And this
one ended early and I was

03:19:54.717 --> 03:19:56.851
listening to some of the
discussion and decided to stop

03:19:59.288 --> 03:20:02.256
by. So thank you for the
comments on this. And you you

03:20:02.991 --> 03:20:05.793
all obviously know the
background. I do want to just

03:20:07.829 --> 03:20:09.829
emphasize a couple things. First

03:20:09.866 --> 03:20:11.866
of all, there is incredible

03:20:13.202 --> 03:20:15.202
community support for the three

03:20:15.538 --> 03:20:17.806
day active activation motion and
car free space that we have now

03:20:20.843 --> 03:20:22.843
had for several years. And to

03:20:23.545 --> 03:20:25.545
undo that on basically a week's

03:20:27.617 --> 03:20:29.617
notice, maybe 8 or 9 days is, I

03:20:31.821 --> 03:20:34.789
believe is would really is not
going over well in the community

03:20:34.990 --> 03:20:36.990
I represent and is not going

03:20:38.194 --> 03:20:40.194
over well with with our office s

03:20:44.568 --> 03:20:46.568
the I would understand the

03:20:46.669 --> 03:20:48.669
board's reluctance given the

03:20:48.772 --> 03:20:50.772
staff recommendation to move

03:20:51.700 --> 03:20:53.700
forward today with a full three

03:20:53.610 --> 03:20:56.478
day closure. And I understand
from the conversations that's
not where the discussion is

03:20:58.581 --> 03:21:00.581
headed. I do not understand and

03:21:02.219 --> 03:21:04.219
want to reiterate our request

03:21:04.388 --> 03:21:06.388
that this matter be continued.

03:21:06.723 --> 03:21:08.723
And there is absolutely no

03:21:08.925 --> 03:21:10.925
reason that all stakeholders

03:21:10.961 --> 03:21:12.961
cannot be brought together to

03:21:13.290 --> 03:21:15.290
plan out an activation that is

03:21:16.166 --> 03:21:18.166
satisfactory to mta staff to

03:21:18.168 --> 03:21:20.168
preserve of this three days here

03:21:24.208 --> 03:21:26.208
at and to. It makes little sense

03:21:26.743 --> 03:21:28.811
to take that action now. Now my
understanding is in terms of

03:21:30.580 --> 03:21:32.681
temporary authorizations that it
could continue on a temporary

03:21:33.183 --> 03:21:35.183
basis through DECEMBER. There's

03:21:36.454 --> 03:21:39.222
nothing expiring here in terms
of authorization to continue on

03:21:40.591 --> 03:21:42.591
a temporary basis at and we

03:21:42.660 --> 03:21:44.660
really run the risk by adopting

03:21:44.728 --> 03:21:46.728
something that limits us to a

03:21:48.980 --> 03:21:50.980
day or even two days of severely

03:21:52.202 --> 03:21:54.202
undermining the program. And

03:21:54.639 --> 03:21:56.807
sending, I think, a message the
opposite of what we should be

03:21:56.941 --> 03:21:59.743
sending in terms of having a
vision of really trying to

03:22:01.470 --> 03:22:03.470
protect and expand the car free

03:22:04.482 --> 03:22:06.483
space in in our city. So I just
want to reiterate the request

03:22:06.851 --> 03:22:08.785
and I know you have multiple
motions and procedurally we'll

03:22:10.454 --> 03:22:13.323
figure out where you want to go
at the same time, I do think a

03:22:13.425 --> 03:22:15.726
motion to continue would be in
order and would take precedence,

03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:18.762
if I'm not mistaken, over the
various, I guess three different

03:22:19.397 --> 03:22:21.397
to three different motions that

03:22:21.566 --> 03:22:23.566
you've got. But what what I've

03:22:24.101 --> 03:22:26.101
not heard at all is any reason

03:22:26.604 --> 03:22:28.604
why this has to be done against

03:22:28.739 --> 03:22:30.739
the wishes of so many in the

03:22:30.775 --> 03:22:32.610
community on about a week's
notice just doesn't make any

03:22:32.978 --> 03:22:34.979
sense. Gives us some space. Our
office community leaders are

03:22:36.815 --> 03:22:38.982
looking forward to doing
whatever it takes to preserve

03:22:39.784 --> 03:22:42.686
this for multiple days. And
finally, I just want to say,

03:22:43.221 --> 03:22:46.123
because as a avid supporter of
public transit in san francisco

03:22:47.893 --> 03:22:49.893
with all due respect, using the

03:22:50.462 --> 03:22:52.462
21 bus as an excuse is not going

03:22:53.131 --> 03:22:55.131
over well. As someone who rides

03:22:56.201 --> 03:22:58.335
that bus daily, that thing is
running once every 20 minutes.

03:22:58.870 --> 03:23:00.870
So if there's a problem with

03:23:01.239 --> 03:23:03.440
service right now, it's not
about the shared spaces and the

03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:07.100
threats of friday activation to

03:23:07.460 --> 03:23:09.881
ongoing bus service. It's the
fact that the bus is barely

03:23:09.982 --> 03:23:12.784
running at this point on a
shortened route three times an

03:23:13.285 --> 03:23:15.319
hour. So supervisor preston, can
I just bring you in? I don't

03:23:15.787 --> 03:23:17.787
know if you've been watching,

03:23:17.923 --> 03:23:20.891
but can I bring you in on on an
important thread of this
conversation and get your

03:23:20.926 --> 03:23:23.128
perspective on this? Sure. I
think that director uchitelle

03:23:23.663 --> 03:23:26.264
made a very compelling point,
which is that we want the rules

03:23:27.566 --> 03:23:29.334
of the road. To be clear, we
want people to understand what's

03:23:29.902 --> 03:23:31.836
going on and that the clearest
solution is actually to look at

03:23:33.439 --> 03:23:35.373
something more like a 24 over
seven closure rather than well,

03:23:35.874 --> 03:23:37.943
which days of the week. I can't
keep track. And this is causing

03:23:37.943 --> 03:23:39.943
frustration and we don't want

03:23:39.979 --> 03:23:41.979
that. I can't even remember what

03:23:42.482 --> 03:23:45.500
what nights it is. And I go
there all the time. So. So

03:23:45.184 --> 03:23:47.986
that's compelling to me. And
that that that that gives an

03:23:47.987 --> 03:23:50.522
opportunity for some more
permanent placemaking and

03:23:51.790 --> 03:23:54.659
permanent community and that you
made the point that popping up

03:23:54.860 --> 03:23:57.162
and going away and popping up
and going away doesn't actually

03:23:57.163 --> 03:23:59.765
kind of create something
meaningful. So I just wonder in

03:24:01.234 --> 03:24:03.402
all your dialogs and
conversations, is that your
vision as well? Look, our

03:24:04.771 --> 03:24:06.772
offices vision is we would
absolutely be supportive of

03:24:08.874 --> 03:24:10.976
looking at ways to expand the
hours we've worked. We've tried

03:24:11.344 --> 03:24:14.120
to balance the various interests
around the days, and I know I've

03:24:15.820 --> 03:24:17.916
spoken with some of you and with
director tumlin about what's

03:24:18.518 --> 03:24:21.487
been an evolving you know,
originally it was a three block

03:24:23.890 --> 03:24:25.890
closure to private vehicles. Has

03:24:26.159 --> 03:24:28.228
since become the one block happy
to discuss. And I think there

03:24:28.228 --> 03:24:30.228
would be significant community

03:24:30.863 --> 03:24:32.999
support for more like a round
the clock type closure. But

03:24:34.568 --> 03:24:36.536
again, I don't think these kind
of decisions should be on the

03:24:37.404 --> 03:24:39.404
fly, constricting it or

03:24:41.708 --> 03:24:43.708
exploring the broader closure.

03:24:43.977 --> 03:24:46.545
The again, there's no reason
these, you know, these kind of

03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:49.280
decisions should be made on

03:24:49.350 --> 03:24:51.618
this. The kind of 7 to 10 day
timeline. So I'm wide open to

03:24:51.986 --> 03:24:54.587
and I appreciate that suggestion
and I do think that would give

03:24:56.256 --> 03:24:59.250
increased clarity to folks. I
think we have to we would have

03:24:59.293 --> 03:25:01.360
to talk to the businesses and
the residents. Right. About

03:25:03.897 --> 03:25:06.732
their views of the of the 24
hour closure. But our office,

03:25:07.502 --> 03:25:10.170
certainly, to the extent there
was community support for that,

03:25:11.172 --> 03:25:13.241
would be supportive of that. But
what I'm concerned about is

03:25:14.175 --> 03:25:16.175
what's before you right now, as

03:25:16.711 --> 03:25:19.579
I understand it, is eliminating
70% of the hours. I will just

03:25:20.648 --> 03:25:22.648
tell you on behalf of my
constituents and from my office

03:25:25.219 --> 03:25:27.219
that that is perceived as and I

03:25:27.322 --> 03:25:29.322
believe accurately perceived as

03:25:29.791 --> 03:25:31.791
a gutting of car free. Hayes

03:25:31.826 --> 03:25:34.427
that is unnecessary. And that to
the extent we can have a

03:25:35.329 --> 03:25:37.297
collaborative discussion and
bring everyone together and

03:25:37.498 --> 03:25:40.300
explore these kind of
possibilities, I see no reason

03:25:41.203 --> 03:25:43.404
that can't be put over a number
of weeks or we had recommended

03:25:45.730 --> 03:25:47.276
early DECEMBER here that I'd
like to go ahead and put my

03:25:47.276 --> 03:25:49.750
motion forward for
consideration. Thank you,

03:25:49.811 --> 03:25:51.811
colleagues. Thank you for being

03:25:51.946 --> 03:25:53.981
here. Did you want to respond to
the supervisor's comments? I

03:25:54.182 --> 03:25:56.182
have a quick point of

03:25:56.284 --> 03:25:59.186
clarification. If I can. Go
ahead. I just wanted to in the

03:26:00.956 --> 03:26:02.956
spirit of things being clear on

03:26:03.125 --> 03:26:05.860
the street and the hours, they
are closed, I just want to make

03:26:06.728 --> 03:26:08.562
sure it's top of mind and doing
my transit colleagues justice

03:26:09.197 --> 03:26:11.498
that as I understand from them,
the friday difficulty of a part

03:26:12.167 --> 03:26:14.101
day is really challenging for
reroute possible. But when it's

03:26:17.706 --> 03:26:19.841
a part day, it is difficult not
just because of the yard

03:26:20.142 --> 03:26:22.844
compared to the weekend, but how
they do it for when it's not a

03:26:23.946 --> 03:26:25.913
whole day. And it impacts riders
as well. When they they know

03:26:28.183 --> 03:26:30.117
know to pick up the bus part of
the day versus another part not

03:26:30.919 --> 03:26:33.200
it's solvable but it is just a
trade off. I want to be

03:26:33.221 --> 03:26:35.924
transparent about for fridays as
well as the fact that we're

03:26:36.826 --> 03:26:39.360
going to be going into earlier
evenings very soon. It'll be

03:26:40.596 --> 03:26:42.897
dark sooner. Yeah. And that just
means nighttime activations are

03:26:44.733 --> 03:26:47.502
just feel a little different
into the winter. Okay. Thank

03:26:47.703 --> 03:26:50.371
you. So I would like to
recommend that we approve. We

03:26:50.438 --> 03:26:52.438
take action today that we

03:26:52.642 --> 03:26:54.643
approve what is before us and
what has been noticed and what

03:26:55.511 --> 03:26:57.579
has been studied of the saturday
permit, because that is a

03:26:57.980 --> 03:26:59.980
foundation as vice chair kahina

03:27:00.583 --> 03:27:02.484
said so eloquently that we can
build upon that is not a

03:27:03.180 --> 03:27:05.220
ceiling. That is a foundation.
So we take that action, we

03:27:06.789 --> 03:27:08.690
approve that piece, we direct
staff to study and explore if

03:27:09.250 --> 03:27:11.250
there are solutions on the

03:27:11.160 --> 03:27:13.362
friday night closure and come
back to us within six months

03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:16.665
with a recommendation. If we
want to add that piece in and

03:27:17.133 --> 03:27:19.133
that we look at what it would

03:27:19.702 --> 03:27:21.804
take a study of what it would
take to actually make it

03:27:21.804 --> 03:27:24.339
permanent to your vision.
Director of the 24 over seven,

03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:26.775
which MAY ultimately be the
evolution that makes the most

03:27:27.377 --> 03:27:29.645
sense for this community. So
that would be three pieces

03:27:31.448 --> 03:27:33.448
moving forward and you would get

03:27:34.417 --> 03:27:36.417
to vote on it today. So jerry

03:27:37.487 --> 03:27:39.487
can for clarity, what was that

03:27:40.490 --> 03:27:42.925
that middle piece? So we've got
we've got the approving ones

03:27:43.794 --> 03:27:46.662
before us today. And the study
of and then we would direct

03:27:47.731 --> 03:27:50.599
staff to look at just rather
than doing this on the fly, we

03:27:50.734 --> 03:27:53.635
would direct staff to look at
the friday night piece which

03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:56.710
we've heard from the community
as meaningful. But rather than

03:27:56.239 --> 03:27:58.239
doing it today, we would study

03:27:58.241 --> 03:28:01.430
that and make sure that we're
working through the issues with
our operators whose concerns we

03:28:02.546 --> 03:28:04.781
take very seriously and come
back to us in six months with a

03:28:04.782 --> 03:28:07.750
recommendation of what you what
you think is the right way to go

03:28:07.918 --> 03:28:10.653
forward to potential add fridays
and study what what it would

03:28:10.954 --> 03:28:13.220
take to make this permanent in
line with so many people's

03:28:14.424 --> 03:28:16.424
visions that we've heard today.

03:28:16.827 --> 03:28:18.827
So then the duration then would

03:28:21.132 --> 03:28:23.700
still be a year or sorry, sorry.
Director lindsay, the permit

03:28:25.736 --> 03:28:28.710
duration, would that still be a
year that under your motion

03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:31.740
permit duration would be a year.

03:28:32.976 --> 03:28:34.976
But I'm open to alternatives. If

03:28:38.416 --> 03:28:40.416
people feel strongly. Right

03:28:40.518 --> 03:28:42.518
right. So you're recommending a

03:28:44.755 --> 03:28:46.755
year as well? Yeah okay. Okay.

03:28:47.658 --> 03:28:50.460
So can I respond to your I mean,
we'll vote on all these
amendments and see where the

03:28:52.263 --> 03:28:55.650
votes hit. But this street
closure has been worked on by

03:28:55.300 --> 03:28:58.235
our staff and by the community
and nauseam. There's been two

03:28:59.204 --> 03:29:01.370
surveys, multiple departments,
the mayor's office, the

03:29:02.574 --> 03:29:04.740
supervisor, his office. I think
there are two competing

03:29:06.144 --> 03:29:08.912
petitions us from from multiple
groups about what should happen

03:29:09.460 --> 03:29:11.848
and should not happen. I just
don't want to send our folks out

03:29:12.717 --> 03:29:14.852
there and have to do like a
whole nother set of surveying

03:29:16.210 --> 03:29:18.789
and look ing and wondering and
just to come back to add five

03:29:19.858 --> 03:29:22.559
hours. And so I just I actually
don't think that more study

03:29:22.660 --> 03:29:25.462
about what the community wants
is what is needed right now. I

03:29:25.863 --> 03:29:27.965
think they need I think they
need to be given their

03:29:28.634 --> 03:29:30.634
parameters of what the street

03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:32.970
closure should be. I think the
merchants have heard loud and

03:29:34.373 --> 03:29:36.607
clear, I don't want to speak for
them that the mta wants certain

03:29:37.809 --> 03:29:39.977
things to be done, not mta, but
also fire the community like

03:29:41.546 --> 03:29:43.147
this has been bruising. So I
think we should we should we

03:29:43.815 --> 03:29:45.850
deserve to give them some
clarity about what this block

03:29:45.850 --> 03:29:48.686
should look like and then we
should give them the opportunity

03:29:50.322 --> 03:29:52.390
to try to make it happen. So I
would just say from the

03:29:52.725 --> 03:29:55.693
perspective of like putting this
to bed a bit, having them like

03:29:56.561 --> 03:29:58.696
we think we might want to give
you friday night, but we want to

03:29:59.464 --> 03:30:02.670
give you like a couple of months
to see if you can do friday

03:30:02.670 --> 03:30:04.903
night. Like it just feels very
unsettling. So I think whatever

03:30:05.710 --> 03:30:07.205
should come out of this, we
should be giving them clear

03:30:07.907 --> 03:30:10.642
parameters. We don't we don't
make them come back to scott and

03:30:10.642 --> 03:30:13.445
go through that whole process
again and then just let them try

03:30:14.680 --> 03:30:17.315
to make this work or not work.
That's just my reaction to your

03:30:17.482 --> 03:30:19.884
to your third. But we should
vote. See what people think

03:30:21.454 --> 03:30:23.454
after the fire forgot how to

03:30:24.957 --> 03:30:26.957
address you. Fire marshal. Fire

03:30:27.260 --> 03:30:29.610
marshal was trying to say
something to us earlier. I

03:30:29.762 --> 03:30:32.665
wonder if he'd like to share. I
just wanted to respond to

03:30:32.665 --> 03:30:34.665
director sos inquiry regarding

03:30:35.968 --> 03:30:38.570
feedback. As as monica stated,
they're not there 24/7. We're

03:30:39.172 --> 03:30:41.774
we're working 24 over seven. And
we provided consistent feedback.

03:30:42.776 --> 03:30:44.943
When we have problems. Actually,
one of the slides, one of the

03:30:45.845 --> 03:30:48.113
pictures was one we took our
when we couldn't get through or

03:30:50.316 --> 03:30:51.850
upon return from a call. So we
you will receive feedback

03:30:52.518 --> 03:30:54.653
because the fire department will
send mta feedback of incidents

03:30:55.755 --> 03:30:58.724
that occur. And that has
happened consistently over the

03:31:01.795 --> 03:31:03.795
last year with lloyd through

03:31:03.864 --> 03:31:05.931
monica has received feedback
regarding it and hence the

03:31:06.199 --> 03:31:08.199
reason why we modified the cones

03:31:08.401 --> 03:31:10.401
in response to the inability to

03:31:12.305 --> 03:31:14.942
staff the ends. So whatever you
approve, we don't the fire

03:31:14.942 --> 03:31:17.777
department doesn't have a
problem with it. We just want to

03:31:18.440 --> 03:31:20.440
be able to get through. Okay.

03:31:20.280 --> 03:31:22.883
That's that's all it is. So we
provide soul feedback on can we

03:31:22.883 --> 03:31:24.883
get through when we need to in

03:31:25.152 --> 03:31:27.253
an emergency situation. So you
will receive consistent feedback

03:31:27.821 --> 03:31:29.889
from us because we have let our
companies in the field know we

03:31:31.425 --> 03:31:33.526
have our own process internally
to feed that through. It goes to

03:31:34.361 --> 03:31:37.197
my office and then I just send a
nice little message over to

03:31:37.431 --> 03:31:39.899
monica and she can go ahead and
archive that. So I want to let

03:31:40.734 --> 03:31:43.103
you know you will receive
feedback, whether it's one day,

03:31:43.103 --> 03:31:45.638
two days, three days through mta
what kind of response we're

03:31:46.540 --> 03:31:49.509
going to give. Okay. So that's
all I wanted to say is you can't

03:31:52.380 --> 03:31:54.380
get feedback. Director tomlin

03:31:54.648 --> 03:31:57.550
can you can you just please
explain how significant of an

03:31:59.687 --> 03:32:01.888
issue the 21 friday piece is?
Because we want to honor the

03:32:03.570 --> 03:32:06.250
fact that this streets change
exists within a part of a
multimodal agency, and we want

03:32:06.995 --> 03:32:08.995
to honor our transit colleagues.

03:32:09.864 --> 03:32:12.766
I can't quite tell how much of a
concern this is. Monica, do you

03:32:14.350 --> 03:32:16.350
want to speak to this or I will

03:32:20.508 --> 03:32:22.508
try my best. So two things is I

03:32:22.543 --> 03:32:24.543
think when they reroute, there's

03:32:24.613 --> 03:32:27.515
certain shifts that an operator
takes. And I think when it's

03:32:27.683 --> 03:32:30.250
broken up and when you only
close the street for the five

03:32:31.553 --> 03:32:33.553
hours in the weekend and on a

03:32:33.688 --> 03:32:36.657
day like on friday, it is proven
to be very difficult for those

03:32:36.758 --> 03:32:39.393
shifts. So an operator comes
into the shift. It could be

03:32:40.228 --> 03:32:43.970
midway through a shift. They've
actually driven through the
closure a few times on fridays

03:32:43.732 --> 03:32:45.967
and we've had photos sent to us
and it's like, oh my goodness,

03:32:47.636 --> 03:32:49.503
and a problem. We can work
through. But it is unique to

03:32:51.506 --> 03:32:53.707
fridays in terms of shift. And
then the second piece again was,

03:32:53.975 --> 03:32:55.975
I believe, the presidio versus

03:32:56.444 --> 03:32:58.746
the kirkland yard, presidio yard
on the friday services trolley

03:33:00.115 --> 03:33:02.115
busses overhead wires. And that

03:33:03.652 --> 03:33:05.652
reroute is also different for

03:33:07.122 --> 03:33:09.122
oh, julie, just in time. We're

03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:12.927
we're a three minute time delay
back there. Okay so I would love

03:33:14.763 --> 03:33:16.763
to just hear what you just said

03:33:17.633 --> 03:33:19.768
and then I'm happy to. Julie I
was explaining about a friday

03:33:20.770 --> 03:33:23.380
closure in the 21 that there are
my understanding the presidio

03:33:24.390 --> 03:33:26.390
serves it on fridays, that there

03:33:26.842 --> 03:33:29.343
are shifts that operator takes.
So if the closure is just 4 to

03:33:29.878 --> 03:33:31.878
10, it has proven to be a little

03:33:32.447 --> 03:33:34.383
bit difficult for operators and
how they're communicating. And

03:33:34.584 --> 03:33:37.453
it could be part way through a
shift versus the weekend and the

03:33:37.453 --> 03:33:40.355
kirkland yard, those operators
have much clearer understanding

03:33:40.723 --> 03:33:42.723
of what they need to do with a

03:33:42.992 --> 03:33:45.827
longer day closure and also the
rubber tire busses can maneuver

03:33:46.529 --> 03:33:48.529
around the closure a little bit

03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:52.900
more easily. So it's clear from

03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:55.871
this discussion that there's a
lot of moving parts to this

03:33:59.410 --> 03:34:01.410
issue and transit does not want

03:34:03.279 --> 03:34:05.279
to be a barrier to follow thing.

03:34:05.481 --> 03:34:07.481
The board's direction on this

03:34:09.119 --> 03:34:11.119
topic. We do currently have to

03:34:13.156 --> 03:34:15.156
go off wire in order to

03:34:17.294 --> 03:34:19.294
implement this change. That's

03:34:19.529 --> 03:34:21.930
very easy to do. When we remove
the wire, the poles from the

03:34:22.665 --> 03:34:24.800
wire because that doesn't
require the operator to get out

03:34:25.869 --> 03:34:27.869
of the vehicle. So it is a

03:34:27.971 --> 03:34:30.406
little harder when we go back
onto the wire because cause even

03:34:32.909 --> 03:34:34.909
with some of the pans we have

03:34:34.978 --> 03:34:36.978
that direct the wire, there's

03:34:39.682 --> 03:34:42.117
still about a 1 in 3 chance that
the operator is going to have to

03:34:42.319 --> 03:34:44.319
get out of the vehicle. We also

03:34:44.321 --> 03:34:46.321
had some challenges is kind of

03:34:48.225 --> 03:34:50.225
with with this friday shutdown

03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:54.630
because it happens mid shift so

03:34:54.798 --> 03:34:56.798
we did have especially when the

03:34:56.934 --> 03:34:58.934
barriers were not put in place,

03:34:59.200 --> 03:35:01.200
we did have operators that

03:35:01.339 --> 03:35:03.339
either didn't receive the proper

03:35:03.841 --> 03:35:05.841
training or just kind of lost

03:35:09.580 --> 03:35:11.580
the. We're not we're not

03:35:12.282 --> 03:35:14.951
expecting it and went through
the project area instead of

03:35:14.985 --> 03:35:16.985
doing the reroute because it

03:35:17.921 --> 03:35:19.921
happens mid-shift it's

03:35:23.270 --> 03:35:25.228
definitely harder to for us to
manage something thing that

03:35:27.698 --> 03:35:29.698
doesn't happen all day long but

03:35:31.702 --> 03:35:33.702
that being said, we have other

03:35:34.380 --> 03:35:37.700
places that we are dealing with
complexity in the transit system

03:35:38.310 --> 03:35:40.310
. So we will certainly be follow

03:35:40.845 --> 03:35:42.845
the board's guidance and make

03:35:44.248 --> 03:35:46.248
whatever our kind of solution we

03:35:48.353 --> 03:35:50.754
come to work. For the 21 days
and for the customers having

03:35:53.592 --> 03:35:56.560
more, much better support on
signage is critical and having

03:35:57.295 --> 03:36:00.165
support on the barriers is
critical, which I know is

03:36:00.165 --> 03:36:02.165
something that we have

03:36:03.101 --> 03:36:05.101
communicated to the project

03:36:07.380 --> 03:36:09.380
sponsors via the via monica.

03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:11.943
Okay. Some times my colleagues
use the term blocking concern.

03:36:12.945 --> 03:36:14.945
Do you have a blocking concern

03:36:14.947 --> 03:36:16.947
with us approving friday night?

03:36:20.385 --> 03:36:23.120
No. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Any
other colleagues want to weigh

03:36:28.127 --> 03:36:30.127
in. Okay. I think procedurally

03:36:30.929 --> 03:36:32.929
I'll look to you, susan, what's

03:36:33.466 --> 03:36:35.466
the best first order of business

03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:38.100
here? We have these three

03:36:39.380 --> 03:36:41.380
motions. You only have one

03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:43.708
motion that has a second motion.
That's a second. Marnie's motion

03:36:44.376 --> 03:36:46.376
on the table. And also for

03:36:48.347 --> 03:36:50.347
procedure for christine is also

03:36:51.884 --> 03:36:53.884
a good resource here. Okay um,

03:36:55.554 --> 03:36:57.554
so can you, can you can you

03:36:57.923 --> 03:36:59.824
restate your motion, director
uchitel, for clarity for

03:37:02.895 --> 03:37:04.895
everyone? It's to amend the item

03:37:05.932 --> 03:37:07.932
to add 5 to 10 P.M. On friday

03:37:09.502 --> 03:37:11.502
nights and to require the sfmta

03:37:11.637 --> 03:37:13.637
to study the cost and the design

03:37:13.940 --> 03:37:16.508
potential design options for a
permanent street closure on this

03:37:21.147 --> 03:37:23.147
block of hayes with been. Six

03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:26.919
months, six months to just study
those questions study the

03:37:27.854 --> 03:37:29.854
permanent peace. Yeah how much

03:37:30.523 --> 03:37:32.523
it would cost and what it could

03:37:33.526 --> 03:37:35.526
look like. Yeah 24 seven but

03:37:36.262 --> 03:37:38.430
that's it. Was it different than
what you were suggesting at

03:37:40.434 --> 03:37:42.434
first? No no, I don't think so.

03:37:46.306 --> 03:37:48.306
No it's seemed to me okay. Is

03:37:50.577 --> 03:37:52.644
she trying to comment? No, I was
just backing up. Director. You

03:37:57.284 --> 03:37:59.419
could you. Okay. And you still
second that motion? Director

03:38:00.854 --> 03:38:02.854
hensley. Yes. Um, yes. Yes.

03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:07.960
Assuming so. Director or deputy
city attorney susan

03:38:11.231 --> 03:38:13.365
cleveland-knowles. You're saying
that we're not going to hold

03:38:14.680 --> 03:38:16.203
your feet to the fire, but
you're saying that this would

03:38:17.538 --> 03:38:19.538
not probably need to go to as

03:38:20.374 --> 03:38:22.374
GOD? So with so we could vote on

03:38:24.645 --> 03:38:26.645
this today and then it come back

03:38:26.680 --> 03:38:28.680
at our next meeting and then

03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:32.830
it'd be would be binding on.

03:38:32.387 --> 03:38:34.387
Yeah. Okay sorry. Director

03:38:38.559 --> 03:38:41.940
hensley. Yes. So the vote today
for director yaku would be to

03:38:41.362 --> 03:38:44.130
amend the resolution that's in
front of you. But because it

03:38:44.932 --> 03:38:46.932
expands the number of days and

03:38:47.535 --> 03:38:49.535
hours noticed for today, that

03:38:50.571 --> 03:38:52.606
resolution would be brought back
to you on NOVEMBER seventh or

03:38:55.376 --> 03:38:57.376
whenever the secretary calendars

03:38:57.378 --> 03:38:59.378
it and you would vote on it at

03:38:59.614 --> 03:39:01.614
that point. We appreciate you.

03:39:01.949 --> 03:39:03.949
Yes. Still second that motion,

03:39:04.151 --> 03:39:06.151
you would vote on the amending

03:39:06.188 --> 03:39:08.188
the resolution today. Yes. Then

03:39:08.356 --> 03:39:10.356
the resolution would be amended.

03:39:10.392 --> 03:39:13.160
And you would then we would re
notice it with the appropriate

03:39:14.290 --> 03:39:16.964
days and times. And it would
come back to you at your next

03:39:18.233 --> 03:39:20.233
meeting. Yes. Okay and it could

03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:23.469
be on your consent calendar or

03:39:27.609 --> 03:39:29.609
not. Okay that's your preference

03:39:31.146 --> 03:39:33.146
to have no action today? Well,

03:39:33.281 --> 03:39:36.217
it's not no action on it's
amending the resolution and you

03:39:37.252 --> 03:39:39.954
guys have to do a vote. You have
to vote on an amended resolution

03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:42.389
. Director hemminger, please.

03:39:43.359 --> 03:39:45.293
Well, I'm not going to make a
motion because we've got plenty

03:39:47.196 --> 03:39:49.230
of those. I do want to ask a
question. Supervisor preston

03:39:51.660 --> 03:39:53.660
indicated that he had gotten

03:39:54.136 --> 03:39:56.136
very little notice about this

03:39:57.372 --> 03:39:59.372
proposal. So what are the facts

03:40:00.476 --> 03:40:02.476
on that question? I'll defer to

03:40:05.948 --> 03:40:07.948
staff. Monica minovitch sure. Um

03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:12.954
the permit expired in MARCH, so
we've been working with the
community since MARCH. They

03:40:14.890 --> 03:40:17.590
were, for example, went to a
public hearing in MARCH because

03:40:18.461 --> 03:40:20.461
the permit expired and we've

03:40:20.563 --> 03:40:22.597
worked directly with the
supervisor's office through the

03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:26.600
summer to while they've been in

03:40:26.736 --> 03:40:28.736
this sort of transition period.

03:40:29.705 --> 03:40:31.705
And and when did the one day

03:40:32.909 --> 03:40:34.909
come up for first versus three

03:40:36.479 --> 03:40:38.479
days, which is the status quo?

03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:41.150
Early SEPTEMBER for about a

03:40:41.551 --> 03:40:44.120
month and a half ago at the
completion of the stakeholder

03:40:44.120 --> 03:40:46.154
meetings is when we first
brought that back to the

03:40:46.255 --> 03:40:48.255
community. Well, labor day

03:40:48.925 --> 03:40:50.925
weekend, you know, there are a

03:40:51.228 --> 03:40:53.296
lot of ideas on the table here
and I'm just trying to

03:40:53.797 --> 03:40:55.797
distinguish among and between

03:40:56.833 --> 03:40:59.134
them. It sounds like director
yakhchals idea cannot take

03:41:00.203 --> 03:41:02.203
effect until a subsequent

03:41:04.974 --> 03:41:07.142
meeting and I don't know why. We
just couldn't take advantage of

03:41:10.114 --> 03:41:12.114
the fact if that's true and I'd

03:41:12.449 --> 03:41:14.449
call it a continuance until that

03:41:15.352 --> 03:41:17.352
meeting. And talk to people and

03:41:18.355 --> 03:41:20.456
vet the idea that he's suggested
as a compromise, which seems

03:41:22.492 --> 03:41:24.492
reasonable to me, and go forth

03:41:25.763 --> 03:41:27.763
from there, you could call it a

03:41:28.332 --> 03:41:30.468
continuance. You could call it a
delayed reaction in which I

03:41:30.768 --> 03:41:32.768
guess is the implication of the

03:41:33.970 --> 03:41:35.970
motion that is on the table from

03:41:36.974 --> 03:41:38.974
director yekutiel. Does that all

03:41:39.109 --> 03:41:41.109
track with you? Council well,

03:41:41.945 --> 03:41:44.781
yes. That is correct. Also, just
because you amend the resolution

03:41:46.817 --> 03:41:48.817
today does not necessarily mean

03:41:50.821 --> 03:41:52.821
you need to have the same vote

03:41:52.957 --> 03:41:55.592
at the next meeting. So you
could approve director yakhchals

03:41:58.280 --> 03:42:00.280
motion today and but you could

03:42:00.465 --> 03:42:02.465
also direct staff to notice it's

03:42:03.968 --> 03:42:06.637
a broader spec item of dates and
times. You know, I'm not going

03:42:06.904 --> 03:42:08.904
to go into potted plants today,

03:42:09.540 --> 03:42:11.741
but but it seems to me this is
one of those moments again. And

03:42:12.576 --> 03:42:14.744
I just don't think we have a
satisfac free way of dealing

03:42:17.470 --> 03:42:19.150
with uncertain certainty because
as you bring a staff

03:42:20.518 --> 03:42:23.121
recommendation to us at a board
meeting, we want to change it,

03:42:23.121 --> 03:42:25.121
which is what policy boards are

03:42:26.791 --> 03:42:28.791
allowed to do. And we're told

03:42:28.926 --> 03:42:30.926
that, oh, in that case you've

03:42:32.196 --> 03:42:34.196
got to wait 30 days or 60 days

03:42:37.469 --> 03:42:39.437
or and it's sort of that
information is being weaponized

03:42:43.441 --> 03:42:45.441
against us. So that we adhere to

03:42:45.810 --> 03:42:48.479
the staff recommend motion
instead of having a better way

03:42:51.449 --> 03:42:53.449
to handle an independent policy

03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:57.870
view. And I think if it has to

03:42:57.255 --> 03:42:59.255
do with just how we organize as

03:42:59.358 --> 03:43:02.126
the meeting and how we
characterize the items so that

03:43:03.662 --> 03:43:05.796
we have some wiggle room in this
case, the wiggle room is one day

03:43:07.132 --> 03:43:09.132
or three and twos in between. So

03:43:10.303 --> 03:43:12.300
if we had written it so that we
could have chosen chosen among

03:43:15.700 --> 03:43:17.700
them again, I just don't think

03:43:18.377 --> 03:43:21.450
the process should be a way of
tipping the scales on whether we

03:43:22.681 --> 03:43:24.681
approve your recommendation on

03:43:25.384 --> 03:43:27.384
or approve one of our own and

03:43:29.255 --> 03:43:32.223
I'm afraid we're stumbling into
that too often. I certainly hear

03:43:33.126 --> 03:43:35.126
what you're saying, director. We

03:43:35.595 --> 03:43:37.796
have talked about this issue
before of making sure that for

03:43:38.464 --> 03:43:40.465
our more challenging or
controversial projects that we

03:43:41.533 --> 03:43:43.533
invest the extra staff time

03:43:44.837 --> 03:43:47.806
necessary to have a discussion
item first to get feedback and

03:43:48.675 --> 03:43:50.675
then do the additional staff

03:43:50.743 --> 03:43:52.743
work to have potential multiple

03:43:52.812 --> 03:43:54.812
completed resolutions is

03:43:54.947 --> 03:43:56.947
available to you. And I realize

03:43:58.584 --> 03:44:00.584
that's a drag, but I do think it

03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:02.920
would allow us to have a pure

03:44:03.230 --> 03:44:05.230
policy discussion instead of

03:44:05.258 --> 03:44:08.160
worrying about what is this
going to trigger this codicil on

03:44:09.896 --> 03:44:11.896
the brown act? Yes. So we're in

03:44:11.931 --> 03:44:13.932
complete agreement. However,
you've also provided us with a

03:44:15.334 --> 03:44:17.402
direction to move a lot more
quickly. And the greatest

03:44:18.905 --> 03:44:20.905
constraints that we face here,

03:44:21.442 --> 03:44:23.442
in addition to money, is staff

03:44:23.944 --> 03:44:25.944
time. And our staff time is our

03:44:26.213 --> 03:44:29.181
staff. Availability is shrinking
dramatically right now. So we

03:44:30.384 --> 03:44:32.384
are simultaneously trying to

03:44:32.419 --> 03:44:34.419
deliver more with fewer people

03:44:34.921 --> 03:44:37.456
and that means making some hard
choices about where are we

03:44:38.325 --> 03:44:40.325
directing the staff time regard

03:44:40.528 --> 03:44:42.528
to with regard to decisions like

03:44:42.696 --> 03:44:44.696
this. In this case, we made a

03:44:45.332 --> 03:44:47.867
judgment that that because what
we were doing, because there's

03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:51.103
agreement about the outcome,
we're wanting to take action

03:44:53.573 --> 03:44:55.641
about the floor or to build from
towards that outcome and that we

03:44:56.100 --> 03:44:58.712
can change that outcome at any
time. We could change it three

03:44:59.113 --> 03:45:02.820
months from now if we figure out
some solutions to the problem.

03:45:02.249 --> 03:45:04.249
But in the meantime, we needed a

03:45:05.252 --> 03:45:07.252
real permit and so in this case,

03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:10.757
the staff recommendation was to
move quickly to establish the

03:45:12.894 --> 03:45:15.829
floor for and then use our staff
time to build success rather

03:45:16.731 --> 03:45:18.765
than using staff time with more
bureaucratic processes and

03:45:19.634 --> 03:45:21.634
writing additional resolution

03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:27.600
for a more for a policy choice

03:45:27.808 --> 03:45:29.976
to happen here. And I have to
say, colleagues, I find that to

03:45:31.379 --> 03:45:33.379
be compelling. And that is why I

03:45:33.481 --> 03:45:35.616
am motivated to act today as
opposed to continue this, which

03:45:36.584 --> 03:45:38.652
then involves more staff time,
more process, more dialog, more

03:45:40.154 --> 03:45:42.154
bureaucracy. And I'll heat up a

03:45:42.991 --> 03:45:44.991
vote today. My bias is to second

03:45:46.661 --> 03:45:48.661
chair egan's motion. The rules

03:45:49.497 --> 03:45:51.497
of order. Thank you. So we have

03:45:51.499 --> 03:45:54.435
two motions with a second and I
want to state something that
according to the slide that I

03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:58.372
got today with the report that
the office of the small

03:45:58.439 --> 03:46:00.439
businesses actually went out and

03:46:01.676 --> 03:46:04.278
conducted aid and reached out to
the merchants on these three

03:46:04.912 --> 03:46:06.912
blocks and 92% of them. And the

03:46:08.684 --> 03:46:10.684
result I'm seeing is that 66% of

03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:15.222
them are in favor for prefer or
satisfied with a one day

03:46:16.591 --> 03:46:19.159
closure. I just want to state
that that on record. So, susan,

03:46:20.962 --> 03:46:22.962
we have two motions now. One is

03:46:22.999 --> 03:46:25.133
for an action today. One is to
amend the motion. How do you

03:46:27.770 --> 03:46:30.400
advise we proceed, christine, do
you want to answer that question

03:46:31.139 --> 03:46:33.139
or my understanding is that you

03:46:33.175 --> 03:46:35.175
would take the first motion

03:46:35.344 --> 03:46:37.344
first. So director patel's

03:46:39.247 --> 03:46:41.247
motion. Okay. Which has a

03:46:41.384 --> 03:46:44.319
second. They both have a second
now. They both do, yes. Okay so

03:46:45.888 --> 03:46:47.888
are we trying to weigh in again?

03:46:48.824 --> 03:46:50.824
Well I was I think trying to ask

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:53.728
you a question because, again,
getting back to the point, I was

03:46:56.809 --> 03:46:58.410
making, there's going to be a
delay either way. Right unless

03:47:01.400 --> 03:47:03.738
your motion is approved. And if
director udall's motion is

03:47:03.873 --> 03:47:05.873
approved, it can't take effect

03:47:06.542 --> 03:47:08.542
until all the next meeting at

03:47:10.446 --> 03:47:13.214
the earliest. Right okay. Yes
yes. Or we can act today.

03:47:14.416 --> 03:47:16.416
Continuing to evaluate friday

03:47:16.619 --> 03:47:18.619
with our transit operators to

03:47:18.622 --> 03:47:21.123
study the 24/7 closure and keep
moving forward of trying to act

03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:26.610
fast. I don't know how much more
, more discussion we need to

03:47:27.130 --> 03:47:29.130
have about one versus two versus

03:47:29.799 --> 03:47:31.799
three. It's three choices. One,

03:47:33.136 --> 03:47:35.136
right after the other. And there

03:47:35.405 --> 03:47:37.405
there clearly is not consensus

03:47:41.945 --> 03:47:43.945
on. Three and one on. And so

03:47:44.314 --> 03:47:46.314
that I believe, is why direct

03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:50.385
tory was trying to come up with
to and so I don't know how much

03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:54.189
more vetting to would have to

03:47:55.225 --> 03:47:58.600
take. But if we do the vetting
and it comes back and we can

03:48:00.300 --> 03:48:02.331
say, okay, we're going to do two
instead, or we're going to keep

03:48:07.538 --> 03:48:09.538
three, or we're going to do. One

03:48:09.574 --> 03:48:12.375
my understanding from staff,
this was always your intention

03:48:13.244 --> 03:48:16.179
on approve this floor today,
continue dialog, continue

03:48:16.180 --> 03:48:18.180
building activation, continue to

03:48:18.181 --> 03:48:20.383
explore what the vision is for
this space. So that's

03:48:21.185 --> 03:48:24.153
consistent. That's right. And in
particular, remove the hardest

03:48:26.524 --> 03:48:29.326
day, which is friday in order to
build success and then once

03:48:29.961 --> 03:48:31.961
there is success, we can

03:48:33.731 --> 03:48:36.533
reevaluate fridays. Can I just
throw another bone in here?

03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:41.437
What? What it sounds like, at
least from the staff
perspective, that friday night

03:48:41.872 --> 03:48:44.410
presents a lot of difficulties.
What if we give them sunday

03:48:48.746 --> 03:48:50.746
instead of friday and. In that

03:48:50.748 --> 03:48:52.748
way we remove the like, the

03:48:53.251 --> 03:48:55.251
potential issues with the shifts

03:48:55.386 --> 03:48:57.587
and the 21 days and I'm just
trying to throw the merchants

03:48:58.122 --> 03:49:00.230
who really love this and think
it's really helpful to their

03:49:01.159 --> 03:49:03.928
businesses a bone here. I am not
advocating for staff to go back

03:49:04.195 --> 03:49:06.864
and do a whole nother round of
surveying and talking to the

03:49:07.832 --> 03:49:10.467
merchants and figuring out one
versus the other. I do not want

03:49:10.835 --> 03:49:12.835
to advocate for that. Director

03:49:18.143 --> 03:49:20.979
henderson. So I what I'm
hearing, I just want to be

03:49:22.481 --> 03:49:24.548
clear. What I'm hearing is not
necessarily go back and study

03:49:26.418 --> 03:49:28.418
one, two or 2 or 3 days, but go

03:49:30.689 --> 03:49:32.689
back and study, move forward

03:49:34.626 --> 03:49:37.495
today and study permanent, which
would be beyond three days. But

03:49:39.310 --> 03:49:41.310
instead, the entire set of

03:49:44.102 --> 03:49:46.102
blocks for or 24 over seven. And

03:49:49.875 --> 03:49:51.875
I think that so I don't think

03:49:52.578 --> 03:49:55.146
that there's a today I don't
hear a choice between the one or

03:49:56.820 --> 03:49:58.820
the two or the three days. It's

03:49:59.351 --> 03:50:01.351
either one, one or or not or we

03:50:01.887 --> 03:50:03.887
continue for this half a day,

03:50:04.289 --> 03:50:05.923
whichever days of the week. I
guess we can work that out with

03:50:08.460 --> 03:50:10.595
the, you know, by next month.
But study but I hear the

03:50:12.298 --> 03:50:14.298
direction is figure out the next

03:50:15.134 --> 03:50:17.134
the possibility for a long term

03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:23.708
24/7 closure right and so can we
make sure that or can we add

03:50:26.412 --> 03:50:28.412
that direction to study to any

03:50:28.415 --> 03:50:30.549
of the motions that come forward
? Because it sounds like that's

03:50:32.218 --> 03:50:34.218
where the that sounds like the

03:50:34.220 --> 03:50:37.550
goal or the end goal of this is
to figure out what's possible

03:50:37.623 --> 03:50:39.623
for the long term, whether

03:50:40.293 --> 03:50:42.494
whether we land on one, two,
three days. I think that was in

03:50:46.299 --> 03:50:48.299
both. Yes. Okay. And so we vote

03:50:49.236 --> 03:50:51.236
now or you know, whenever your

03:50:51.338 --> 03:50:53.338
direction is. But we vote first

03:50:56.609 --> 03:50:58.609
on on director hotels. Day and a

03:51:00.246 --> 03:51:02.246
half proposal and we don't does

03:51:02.249 --> 03:51:04.249
that day and a half have to be

03:51:05.520 --> 03:51:07.587
specific like do we have to say
15 hours between friday and

03:51:09.389 --> 03:51:11.791
saturday or can it be open like
we were suggesting in the staff

03:51:12.993 --> 03:51:14.993
and the merchant groups? Figure

03:51:15.695 --> 03:51:18.430
out the best 15 hours of the
weekend to do it. Can I respond

03:51:19.980 --> 03:51:21.980
to that? The reason I proposed

03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:23.369
friday night is because it was
communicated to me from the

03:51:24.471 --> 03:51:27.273
merchants that that period of
time that that luscious kernel

03:51:29.276 --> 03:51:32.780
of time was the time that people
were utilizing this space the

03:51:33.413 --> 03:51:35.314
most. And so trying to protect
the time that people are

03:51:36.116 --> 03:51:38.116
actually going to hayes valley

03:51:38.119 --> 03:51:40.487
and eating and want to be out on
the street. And we all want it

03:51:41.322 --> 03:51:43.322
to be successful. But so the

03:51:43.591 --> 03:51:45.591
idea is giving them a little bit

03:51:45.693 --> 03:51:48.629
of more of that time to utilize.
And so that's why I wanted it to

03:51:48.696 --> 03:51:51.531
be specific, because we've done
a lot of feedback. We've done a

03:51:51.832 --> 03:51:54.467
lot of surveying. That's what's
been communicated to me as like

03:51:54.669 --> 03:51:56.669
an important time not to lose.

03:51:58.390 --> 03:52:00.874
Okay so yeah, I do want to keep
it specific. I do want to I do

03:52:02.577 --> 03:52:04.546
want to amend the resolution to
add friday nights. We both are

03:52:05.460 --> 03:52:07.130
in agreement that we want to
study what 24 hours would look

03:52:08.282 --> 03:52:11.251
like, though. Okay so just from
a process standpoint, so

03:52:11.652 --> 03:52:13.654
everyone understands if director
kaushal's motion is approved,

03:52:14.622 --> 03:52:17.358
that's it, then there's not a
possibility to take an action

03:52:19.527 --> 03:52:22.162
today, correct? Sure you can. If
I could correct myself. I'm
sorry. Okay the substitute

03:52:24.532 --> 03:52:26.532
motion should be voted on first.

03:52:27.268 --> 03:52:29.350
So your your motion. The second
one should be voted on first and

03:52:30.380 --> 03:52:32.707
then we can go to the original
motion. Okay. And then process

03:52:33.308 --> 03:52:36.243
wise, if that motion to approve
today and study the longer term

03:52:36.244 --> 03:52:39.790
as director henderson laid out,
if that's approved, how do we

03:52:42.450 --> 03:52:44.585
then why accurately consider the
other motion? Because that feels

03:52:46.220 --> 03:52:48.220
like direction today. Whatever.

03:52:49.291 --> 03:52:52.260
If the first motion that's voted
on is approved, then that's

03:52:54.196 --> 03:52:56.196
that's done. Okay, but not like

03:52:57.265 --> 03:52:59.265
a why not me vibe. But if I, I

03:52:59.368 --> 03:53:02.360
propose my motion first and it
was seconded first and shouldn't

03:53:03.405 --> 03:53:06.242
shouldn't since that was the
first amendment, that motion
that was proposed in second,

03:53:06.242 --> 03:53:09.210
shouldn't that do I not
understand the rules properly?

03:53:09.378 --> 03:53:12.113
Maybe I don't. Is that the
direction of our secretary if I

03:53:12.614 --> 03:53:15.416
don't at this point, five years
later, the situation should get

03:53:16.118 --> 03:53:18.118
voted on first? Is there any

03:53:20.789 --> 03:53:22.789
understanding as a substitute.

03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:25.590
I've been substituted. You're

03:53:25.294 --> 03:53:27.362
the main motion. No, she's the
substitute. Your main motion.

03:53:30.166 --> 03:53:32.100
Okay okay. So we're going to
call a vote on the proposal,

03:53:33.702 --> 03:53:36.337
which is to move forward today.
Move forward with the floor of

03:53:36.772 --> 03:53:38.772
saturday. Closure for directing

03:53:38.807 --> 03:53:40.807
staff to study the question

03:53:41.111 --> 03:53:43.146
that's been raised of the friday
night and just make sure that

03:53:43.146 --> 03:53:45.948
works for our transit partners
to bring back as soon as you're

03:53:46.115 --> 03:53:48.884
ready recommendation on that
piece as well as to study the

03:53:49.850 --> 03:53:51.850
larger 24 over seven closure,

03:53:51.187 --> 03:53:53.889
which has been seconded. Could
you please call the roll on that

03:53:54.323 --> 03:53:56.491
motion? This is your this is
chair eakins motion. Correct.

03:53:56.994 --> 03:53:59.261
Okay. Correct it. If I MAY, just
quickly ask the city attorney,

03:54:02.399 --> 03:54:04.399
there was a resolve clause that

03:54:04.534 --> 03:54:06.534
that staff needed to add to this

03:54:08.238 --> 03:54:10.238
approval. Yes. That is correct.

03:54:10.506 --> 03:54:12.506
The vehicle code requires for a

03:54:13.900 --> 03:54:14.509
road closure that your
resolution includes the

03:54:16.747 --> 03:54:18.814
following an additional resolve
clause that for the reasons

03:54:19.683 --> 03:54:21.683
discussed in the public hearing,

03:54:21.718 --> 03:54:23.486
the sfmta board finds that the
street closure is necessary for

03:54:24.621 --> 03:54:26.755
the safety and protection of
persons who are using that

03:54:27.123 --> 03:54:29.123
portion of the street during the

03:54:29.492 --> 03:54:31.927
closure. So, chair aitken, if
you could amend your motion to

03:54:32.930 --> 03:54:35.464
include that language, so we
would appreciate it. Thank you.

03:54:35.666 --> 03:54:37.666
Deputy city attorney

motion director uk'otoa's motion

03:55:24.749 --> 03:55:26.749

area on hyde street between

03:57:15.762 --> 03:57:18.497
approving various traffic and
parking modifications between

03:57:18.731 --> 03:57:20.731
geary and mcallister streets to

03:57:21.340 --> 03:57:23.201
improve transit and pedestrian
safety as part of the hyde

03:57:25.938 --> 03:57:27.938
street. Quick build project

03:57:30.143 --> 03:57:32.143
includes items a through. To you

03:57:53.333 --> 03:57:55.333
in the agenda. Okay.

03:57:56.236 --> 03:57:58.236
Can you hear me okay? Yes, go

ahead. Thank you. Um. Thanks.

03:58:10.351 --> 03:58:12.351
Good afternoon, chair ekin

03:58:12.953 --> 03:58:15.187
directors. My name is jennifer
molina and my senior

03:58:15.756 --> 03:58:17.756
transportation planner in the

03:58:18.250 --> 03:58:20.894
streets division in the project
manager for the hyde street

03:58:20.962 --> 03:58:23.196
quick build. I'd like to
recognize the entire project

03:58:23.898 --> 03:58:26.366
team. This project was a team
effort across multiple

03:58:27.635 --> 03:58:29.769
divisions. But most importantly,
this project would not be before

03:58:30.171 --> 03:58:32.705
the board today without the
determination of the tenderloin

03:58:37.445 --> 03:58:40.147
community. Before jumping to
hyde street, I want to provide a

03:58:40.215 --> 03:58:42.115
quick overview. Two of the
important work city staff and

03:58:43.551 --> 03:58:45.485
community partners have
accomplished over the past

03:58:45.987 --> 03:58:47.987
several years in the tenderloin.

03:58:48.422 --> 03:58:50.424
This map highlights the various
traffic safety and street

03:58:51.325 --> 03:58:54.270
changes that have taken place in
the community. This includes

03:58:55.970 --> 03:58:57.970
four quick builds, two shared

03:58:57.732 --> 03:58:59.732
spaces and a neighborhood wide

03:58:59.801 --> 03:59:01.801
no turn on red and speed limit

03:59:03.805 --> 03:59:05.906
reduction from 25 to 20mph. This
work would not have been

03:59:05.974 --> 03:59:08.750
possible without the dedicated
advocacy work of those who live

03:59:11.579 --> 03:59:14.448
and work in the tenderloin. So
hyde street quick build. It's

03:59:14.583 --> 03:59:16.617
the fifth quick build in the
tenderloin. Our quick build

03:59:17.586 --> 03:59:20.521
efforts continue to inform our
agency's ongoing outreach and

03:59:21.756 --> 03:59:23.756
engagement practices. Hyde's

03:59:25.293 --> 03:59:28.262
outreach process was centered on
partnering with community
residential based groups within

03:59:30.799 --> 03:59:32.867
the community. Also, I want to
point out that this team

03:59:33.769 --> 03:59:36.470
continues to work closely with
our transit priority team, who

03:59:37.206 --> 03:59:39.206
are leading the high transit

03:59:39.775 --> 03:59:41.909
project that that went to the
board earlier this month. This

03:59:42.777 --> 03:59:45.446
ongoing ongoing coordination was
key to advancing this proposal.

03:59:48.317 --> 03:59:50.317
proposal you see today. So hyde

03:59:50.453 --> 03:59:52.453
street today, hyde street is

03:59:53.356 --> 03:59:55.723
busy, mixed use corridor with a
variety of civic facilities,

03:59:56.725 --> 03:59:58.725
libraries, parks, as well as

03:59:58.994 --> 04:00:00.994
small businesses, apartments,

04:00:02.564 --> 04:00:04.564
sros and health and service

04:00:05.301 --> 04:00:07.703
oriented organizations. It's
also a very popular pedestrian

04:00:08.504 --> 04:00:11.207
corridor for those walking or
strolling and rolling,

04:00:11.207 --> 04:00:13.207
especially for families, seniors

04:00:14.430 --> 04:00:16.978
and people with disabilities.
High street is a one way

04:00:17.680 --> 04:00:20.448
southbound corridor with three
vehicle lanes between geary and

04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:24.152
mcallister street. It also has
parking on both sides of the

04:00:25.955 --> 04:00:28.590
roadway and loading the 19, polk
wrote in three golden gate

04:00:28.725 --> 04:00:30.959
transit regional bus routes
travel on the hyde street within

04:00:32.280 --> 04:00:34.696
this project corridor to the 19,
polk connects several
neighborhoods, including

04:00:35.364 --> 04:00:37.364
neighborhoods identified in the

04:00:40.570 --> 04:00:42.705
muni service equity strategy on
average, one person on hyde is

04:00:44.507 --> 04:00:46.507
hit every month based on five

04:00:46.709 --> 04:00:48.777
years of collision data over
half of those collisions are

04:00:49.913 --> 04:00:52.381
pedestrians. The top three most
frequent crashes crash types are

04:00:53.549 --> 04:00:55.549
drivers failure to lead and

04:00:55.618 --> 04:00:58.287
yield in the crosswalk, followed
by red light violations and

04:01:03.527 --> 04:01:05.961
unsafe speeds. Starting in fall
of 2022, our project team

04:01:05.962 --> 04:01:08.264
focused on listening and
relationship building with

04:01:08.798 --> 04:01:11.467
community stakeholders along
hyde and nearby. This work

04:01:12.202 --> 04:01:14.202
included several visioning

04:01:14.371 --> 04:01:16.372
sessions with our community
partners to co-develop an

04:01:17.410 --> 04:01:19.410
outreach plan. Partners included

04:01:19.810 --> 04:01:21.811
organized and residents from the
community, including the

04:01:22.746 --> 04:01:24.746
tenderloin, people's congress,

04:01:25.820 --> 04:01:27.984
cbd, safe passage, the
tenderloin, traffic safety task

04:01:28.852 --> 04:01:30.852
force and code tenderloin in

04:01:32.623 --> 04:01:35.580
winter of spring of 2023, the
outreach team focused mostly on

04:01:35.893 --> 04:01:38.495
in-person engagement, including
pop ups in block to block

04:01:39.997 --> 04:01:42.832
outreach stakeholder meetings
were also set up to connect with

04:01:42.867 --> 04:01:44.968
community and resident based
groups, both virtually and in

04:01:49.808 --> 04:01:52.142
person. So during this listening
period, the outreach team

04:01:53.244 --> 04:01:55.244
collected hundreds of surveys,

04:01:55.346 --> 04:01:57.914
mostly in person, to understand
project priorities and top

04:01:59.183 --> 04:02:01.183
traffic safety concerns. The top

04:02:01.352 --> 04:02:03.352
four priorities include ensuring

04:02:03.421 --> 04:02:05.421
pedestrian safety, improving

04:02:05.723 --> 04:02:08.692
transit reliability, considering
a protected mobility lane and

04:02:13.464 --> 04:02:15.464
speed reduction on. So based on

04:02:15.667 --> 04:02:18.468
these priorities and the
feedback collected on both

04:02:19.700 --> 04:02:21.700
phases of outreach staff

04:02:24.242 --> 04:02:26.242
recommend actually, I apologize.

04:02:26.245 --> 04:02:29.146
Slide eight building up the
team's first phase of outreach,
the project team developed two

04:02:30.480 --> 04:02:32.480
quick build design options as

04:02:32.500 --> 04:02:34.985
understanding a hybrid approach
was important for outreach. The

04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:38.870
team developed an interactive

04:02:38.656 --> 04:02:40.657
story map that presented project
background and walked viewers

04:02:41.125 --> 04:02:43.125
through proposals with an option

04:02:43.562 --> 04:02:45.562
to take a brief survey. Our

04:02:45.964 --> 04:02:47.965
outreach team also organized
several in-person tabling events

04:02:48.534 --> 04:02:51.350
and workshops at trusted
community spaces and sros to

04:02:52.537 --> 04:02:54.537
review designs and engage with

04:02:55.440 --> 04:02:57.441
project staff. These workshops
included monolingual events in

04:03:02.581 --> 04:03:04.581
both spanish and chinese. Okay

04:03:04.850 --> 04:03:07.518
so based on these priorities and
feedback during both phases of

04:03:08.721 --> 04:03:11.189
outreach, staff are recommending
advancing a road diet between

04:03:12.825 --> 04:03:15.426
geary and eddy in a transit only
lane from eddy to mcallister

04:03:15.661 --> 04:03:17.661
street intersection safety

04:03:18.970 --> 04:03:20.565
improvements at ellis and eddy
would include painted safety

04:03:21.200 --> 04:03:23.200
zones and left turn safety

04:03:24.770 --> 04:03:26.771
treatments. The project also
includes a modest curb

04:03:27.390 --> 04:03:29.941
management plan that proposes
additional or extended color

04:03:31.977 --> 04:03:34.812
curb to provide more space for
loading and also to deter double

04:03:39.986 --> 04:03:42.854
parking. Given the growing
interest in the community to see

04:03:42.989 --> 04:03:45.570
a protected north to south.
Mobility lane in the

04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:47.992
neighborhood, the team did
propose a similar design to our

04:03:48.361 --> 04:03:50.896
recommendation that also
included an east side running

04:03:51.965 --> 04:03:53.965
mobility lane. The design

04:03:54.401 --> 04:03:56.769
proposal for a quick build was
was limited by several

04:03:57.504 --> 04:04:00.205
constraints for the project team
that included existing bulb

04:04:01.400 --> 04:04:03.400
outs, muni service loading and

04:04:03.376 --> 04:04:05.376
parking in emergency response

04:04:06.245 --> 04:04:09.140
needs. One of the major trade
offs with the design. With this

04:04:09.416 --> 04:04:12.151
design specifically was that all
east side parking and loading

04:04:12.352 --> 04:04:14.352
would need to be removed for the

04:04:17.257 --> 04:04:20.192
entire six blocks. While it was
clear that the tenderloin
community is in support of a

04:04:21.228 --> 04:04:24.196
protected mobility lane, the
design this design would further

04:04:24.197 --> 04:04:26.598
exacerbate parking and loading
challenges, especially for small

04:04:27.268 --> 04:04:29.769
businesses, but also for
paratransit and taxi services.

04:04:31.905 --> 04:04:34.107
Staff are still committed to
working with the tenderloin

04:04:34.208 --> 04:04:36.142
community to identify a north
and south mobility lane. There

04:04:37.677 --> 04:04:39.745
is currently an opportunity to
identify future active

04:04:40.313 --> 04:04:42.313
transportation projects and

04:04:42.782 --> 04:04:44.782
policies with within the active

04:04:48.355 --> 04:04:50.355
communities plan. So so given

04:04:50.458 --> 04:04:52.559
the team's recommendation today,
we are asking the board to

04:04:52.760 --> 04:04:54.760
consider for approving the

04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:57.497
transit lanes on hyde street
between eddy and mcallister

04:04:58.665 --> 04:05:00.665
street in improving traffic and

04:05:00.901 --> 04:05:03.604
parking modifications on hyde
between geary and mcallister

04:05:04.872 --> 04:05:06.872
streets. If approved, quick

04:05:07.108 --> 04:05:09.209
build implementation would start
in late OCTOBER into early

04:05:11.646 --> 04:05:14.313
NOVEMBER. For this project will
also be followed by a six month

04:05:15.816 --> 04:05:17.816
evaluation in spring of 2024.

04:05:18.850 --> 04:05:20.654
Our project work will also
include ongoing coordination

04:05:21.556 --> 04:05:24.258
with our transit colleagues,
both in construction and project

04:05:26.928 --> 04:05:28.928
evaluation. That concludes my

04:05:30.264 --> 04:05:32.264
presentation. An and thank you

04:05:32.567 --> 04:05:35.135
for your time. Thank you so much
for your presentation. Jennifer

04:05:35.136 --> 04:05:37.905
directors, are there any
clarifying questions? Yes, I did

04:05:38.974 --> 04:05:41.875
have some questions, but I'm
very scared. If I MAY. Yes,

04:05:44.112 --> 04:05:46.112
please. Before director lindsay.

04:05:48.249 --> 04:05:50.249
Um just a few comments and

04:05:50.618 --> 04:05:52.618
questions. First question

04:05:53.321 --> 04:05:56.190
questions. I know that when the
transit only lane came before us

04:05:57.693 --> 04:05:59.693
last week, we talked to we

04:06:02.130 --> 04:06:04.130
talked about an express some

04:06:06.670 --> 04:06:08.670
concern around the fulton plaza,

04:06:10.105 --> 04:06:12.340
um, surrounding areas. And I, I
know that staff has been doing

04:06:13.776 --> 04:06:15.776
some work around those

04:06:16.278 --> 04:06:18.278
intersections. So I don't know

04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:20.580
if kimberly or jennifer, you

04:06:20.849 --> 04:06:23.417
want to sort of summarize at a
high level where we're at with

04:06:25.454 --> 04:06:27.454
those, um, with those

04:06:30.920 --> 04:06:31.960
discussions. Sure I can speak to
the updates that I have. And

04:06:33.290 --> 04:06:35.290
also kimberly is here to add if

04:06:36.766 --> 04:06:39.634
needed. So thank you, director,
for that question. Yes and so as

04:06:40.636 --> 04:06:43.710
part we did receive some
feedback from community members

04:06:43.872 --> 04:06:46.607
around some of the pedestrian
safety concerns they had at

04:06:47.443 --> 04:06:49.443
fulton and hyde as well as

04:06:49.712 --> 04:06:52.514
fulton and larkin. And that's
really essentially with the

04:06:53.490 --> 04:06:55.490
farmers market moving over to

04:06:59.121 --> 04:07:01.690
the fulton plaza, the there is a
there is a concern around

04:07:02.525 --> 04:07:04.580
people, particularly seniors and
people with disabilities,

04:07:06.129 --> 04:07:09.640
accessing that and crossing over
. So our team did actually look

04:07:11.601 --> 04:07:13.601
at some options. And we are we

04:07:13.703 --> 04:07:16.672
are recommending right now is
installing large wide painted

04:07:19.308 --> 04:07:21.308
safety zones is essentially to

04:07:22.179 --> 04:07:24.179
shorten the crossing distance

04:07:24.715 --> 04:07:27.830
for people, but to also increase
visibility through the

04:07:29.986 --> 04:07:31.986
application of post and some

04:07:32.589 --> 04:07:34.857
khaki khaki paint essentially.
And that one we know is feasible

04:07:35.792 --> 04:07:37.792
on the larkin. So on the west

04:07:38.294 --> 04:07:40.596
side of larkin, we can do so.
It's just a beefed up version of

04:07:40.864 --> 04:07:42.864
a painted safety zone. We've

04:07:42.866 --> 04:07:44.866
done it along. Lincoln and this

04:07:45.702 --> 04:07:47.303
is something we know we can do
and do fairly quickly. The

04:07:49.600 --> 04:07:51.407
option on hyde and fulton is a
little bit more complex since

04:07:52.209 --> 04:07:55.770
we're working with our transit
colleagues as well as there's

04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:58.790
ongoing construction with the

04:07:58.820 --> 04:08:00.917
with the project work that our
colleagues over at ruskin park

04:08:04.555 --> 04:08:06.555
are doing. We have to see if and

04:08:07.291 --> 04:08:09.291
when that actual application of

04:08:09.393 --> 04:08:11.794
a large painted safety zone
would be actually feasible and

04:08:11.795 --> 04:08:13.795
so that's ongoing conversation

04:08:14.699 --> 04:08:17.534
with with transit and our city
colleagues. But we are committed

04:08:18.402 --> 04:08:20.403
to the larkin and fulton
application of a large

04:08:20.571 --> 04:08:22.571
pedestrian safety painted safety

04:08:23.307 --> 04:08:26.242
zone. And that I think at this
point we anticipate we could

04:08:28.345 --> 04:08:30.380
complete that by end of year.
Excellent. And thank you for

04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:35.352
looking into that so quickly and
um, we've, we've had a lot of

04:08:36.320 --> 04:08:38.320
conversations around and other

04:08:38.489 --> 04:08:41.157
hearings today and needing to
come back with other hearings.

04:08:46.263 --> 04:08:48.398
So um, and I don't want, I don't
want to put the community

04:08:49.868 --> 04:08:51.868
through another hearing so can

04:08:51.903 --> 04:08:54.605
you maybe clarify that we
wouldn't need a additional

04:08:56.141 --> 04:08:58.108
legislation? Yeah. No, that's a
great question. I think well,

04:08:58.910 --> 04:09:00.910
essentially for the larkin

04:09:02.947 --> 04:09:04.947
fulton location in the area

04:09:05.316 --> 04:09:07.585
where we're actually proposed
posing a painted safety note

04:09:08.820 --> 04:09:11.522
painted safety zone is already a
tan set. So essentially we

04:09:12.391 --> 04:09:14.892
wouldn't we wouldn't have to go
through through a legislation

04:09:15.560 --> 04:09:17.560
process there. The other

04:09:17.962 --> 04:09:20.764
location, again, I don't have
information on the hyde fulton

04:09:22.700 --> 04:09:25.303
location. We still need to see
if and when that's actually

04:09:27.506 --> 04:09:29.840
possible. Yes. And then my last
question and then have comments

04:09:31.743 --> 04:09:34.512
and gratitude for the team. But
our last question is, I know

04:09:35.947 --> 04:09:37.947
that there is some concern

04:09:42.210 --> 04:09:44.210
around when the this segment of

04:09:45.124 --> 04:09:47.124
the transit only lane is going

04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:51.610
to be color colorized. And I, I

04:09:53.198 --> 04:09:55.198
know that transit technically

04:09:56.168 --> 04:09:58.569
considers is this a you know
highlight while we look at the

04:09:59.438 --> 04:10:01.438
design so if we if you could

04:10:01.574 --> 04:10:03.475
speak to that speak to that I
know staff intends to colorize

04:10:05.845 --> 04:10:07.845
it at some point in the future.

04:10:09.315 --> 04:10:11.416
No thank you for that question.
And I do want to note some

04:10:11.917 --> 04:10:13.985
transit only lanes in the city
are not necessarily colorized

04:10:17.900 --> 04:10:19.758
red. So in terms of the question
around and I just want to

04:10:21.427 --> 04:10:24.296
confirm you're asking whether
the section from eddie to

04:10:25.197 --> 04:10:27.197
mcallister would be colorized

04:10:29.350 --> 04:10:31.350
red, correct? Yep correct. All

04:10:32.638 --> 04:10:34.638
right. Thanks. Well, at this

04:10:35.142 --> 04:10:37.643
time, we are not colorizing the
section between mcallister and

04:10:41.348 --> 04:10:43.916
eddie red. We our plan is to
actually evaluate the
effectiveness, effectiveness of

04:10:45.318 --> 04:10:46.985
the travel of the transit lane
as part of our six month

04:10:48.288 --> 04:10:50.288
evaluation plan, including

04:10:50.289 --> 04:10:52.289
looking at transit travel times

04:10:52.526 --> 04:10:54.526
and the reliability of the 19.

04:10:54.828 --> 04:10:56.762
Poke our conversation with our
transit colleagues is

04:10:57.640 --> 04:10:59.640
essentially any reduction in the

04:10:59.733 --> 04:11:01.733
speed or impact to the 19 poke

04:11:02.169 --> 04:11:03.802
will require us to review and
look at the revision of our

04:11:05.171 --> 04:11:07.172
design, how it's functioned
operationally wise, like in

04:11:08.776 --> 04:11:11.277
terms of our our lanes, how
operators are feeling and then

04:11:12.146 --> 04:11:14.146
that would include the option to

04:11:14.915 --> 04:11:16.849
colorize to increase driver
compliance between eddie and

04:11:17.451 --> 04:11:19.986
mcallister street. I think this
evaluation actually the timeline

04:11:22.220 --> 04:11:24.230
syncs up really well with our
agency's commitment to colorize

04:11:24.591 --> 04:11:26.591
hyde between mcallister and

04:11:28.196 --> 04:11:30.363
market in mid 2024. So meaning
the entire eight blocks could be

04:11:30.531 --> 04:11:32.531
colorized on a similar timeline.

04:11:32.700 --> 04:11:34.700
But we really would like to use

04:11:34.869 --> 04:11:36.803
this time to make observations
and monitor how this extension

04:11:37.771 --> 04:11:39.771
of the transit only lane on hyde

04:11:43.377 --> 04:11:45.377
is working. I would. I would

04:11:47.481 --> 04:11:49.481
actually agree with you. You you

04:11:50.785 --> 04:11:52.785
you know as well as I do that um

04:11:53.788 --> 04:11:55.788
that this project for the

04:11:56.230 --> 04:11:58.892
transit lane is it's also a
transit lane but it's also a

04:12:00.962 --> 04:12:03.230
road diet. But I know because of
the design of the transit lane

04:12:08.169 --> 04:12:10.270
that we need to assess the
effectiveness of a transit lane.

04:12:12.473 --> 04:12:14.741
But it it is critical as a road
diet. But I do understand that

04:12:16.511 --> 04:12:18.511
we need we need to evaluate it

04:12:20.649 --> 04:12:23.484
before we paint it red. So I I'm
actually and I know that staff

04:12:24.920 --> 04:12:26.920
knows that in portions of the

04:12:28.289 --> 04:12:30.289
road diet to the community. So

04:12:30.291 --> 04:12:32.291
those are those are my questions

04:12:34.729 --> 04:12:36.729
and colleagues I have been sort

04:12:36.899 --> 04:12:38.899
of involved in the outreach

04:12:40.269 --> 04:12:42.269
process and working sort of I've

04:12:42.371 --> 04:12:44.371
had jennifer can attest I've had

04:12:44.406 --> 04:12:47.141
many meetings with staff about
this and I just want to

04:12:48.243 --> 04:12:50.243
emphasize that jennifer has done

04:12:51.980 --> 04:12:53.980
a very intense level of outreach

04:12:56.318 --> 04:12:59.120
to the community. And she was
being very modest in regards to

04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:02.889
the amount of work that she's

04:13:03.759 --> 04:13:06.727
done. So I did just want to read
commend the team for this model

04:13:08.597 --> 04:13:10.698
of outreach that we've taken up.
And I know that you will.

04:13:11.134 --> 04:13:13.134
There's a commitment there to

04:13:13.770 --> 04:13:15.770
work with the tenant and

04:13:16.639 --> 04:13:18.840
continue to work with the
tenderloin community. Also so

04:13:20.543 --> 04:13:22.744
and I know that there is a
vision within the tenderloin

04:13:25.881 --> 04:13:27.881
community to have a protected

04:13:28.283 --> 04:13:30.283
bike lane of some sort someday.

04:13:31.121 --> 04:13:33.121
And I know that staff isn't

04:13:33.156 --> 04:13:35.156
necessarily giving up on giving

04:13:37.326 --> 04:13:39.326
up on that. So I will. And I

04:13:40.963 --> 04:13:42.963
know that we'll continue to do

04:13:43.265 --> 04:13:45.834
an increased amount of work in
the tenderloin. And so I just

04:13:46.937 --> 04:13:49.772
want to acknowledge that. And I
think to that end, kerrigan

04:13:52.442 --> 04:13:54.442
pending discussion and public

04:13:54.711 --> 04:13:56.711
comment, I will make a motion to

04:13:56.813 --> 04:13:58.813
approve the project. Second, it

04:13:58.848 --> 04:14:00.848
great. There's a motion and a

04:14:01.170 --> 04:14:03.170
second we don't have any other

04:14:05.255 --> 04:14:07.255
director comments. You took your

04:14:07.724 --> 04:14:09.592
hand down. So let's go to public
comment please. For anyone in

04:14:19.350 --> 04:14:21.350
the room on this item.

04:14:21.205 --> 04:14:23.740
Hey, good afternoon. My name is
simon viloria, organizer and

04:14:24.842 --> 04:14:26.842
co-chair for the traffic safety

04:14:27.344 --> 04:14:29.344
task force. First off, thank you

04:14:29.379 --> 04:14:32.470
again to jennifer and mta staff
for the engagement and continued

04:14:34.317 --> 04:14:36.385
communication with our community
. Um, I've already mentioned in

04:14:37.587 --> 04:14:39.587
last meeting, but again, want to

04:14:39.657 --> 04:14:41.891
reiterate the need for this
project to be done

04:14:42.793 --> 04:14:45.361
simultaneously as the rest of
hyde street. I know it's also

04:14:46.497 --> 04:14:48.498
frustrating that added
complications to this project

04:14:49.833 --> 04:14:51.833
with one chunk having a separate

04:14:52.336 --> 04:14:55.710
hearing as well as an additional
issue on pedestrian safety with

04:14:56.341 --> 04:14:58.341
the market moving, I understand

04:14:58.509 --> 04:15:00.677
that this wasn't anticipated and
I think staff might share the

04:15:01.679 --> 04:15:03.679
same frustration. So I just want

04:15:03.748 --> 04:15:06.283
to put that on record. Also, we
need a solid commitment of

04:15:06.283 --> 04:15:08.283
painting the transit only lane

04:15:10.540 --> 04:15:12.540
red and evaluate before and

04:15:12.890 --> 04:15:14.224
after colorizing as colorized
transit lanes is a greater

04:15:14.859 --> 04:15:16.859
visual indicator of road diet.

04:15:17.195 --> 04:15:19.463
And with the problems in the
lack of enforcement, it MAY also

04:15:20.980 --> 04:15:22.980
act as a deterrent. And then

04:15:23.434 --> 04:15:25.302
finally, we ask that we continue
to be transparent and to

04:15:25.970 --> 04:15:27.970
continue clear communications

04:15:28.172 --> 04:15:30.172
with the community of the

04:15:30.474 --> 04:15:32.474
evaluation results and if any

04:15:32.477 --> 04:15:35.146
changes will be made. And this
will help continue to build

04:15:36.470 --> 04:15:38.470
trust, exemplify this culture of

04:15:38.350 --> 04:15:40.350
care and put equity policies

04:15:41.486 --> 04:15:43.387
into action. So again, thank you
for your time. Thank you to mta

04:15:43.955 --> 04:15:45.955
and looking forward to getting

04:15:46.123 --> 04:15:48.123
this project completed. Thank

04:15:51.430 --> 04:15:53.430
you. Next speaker, please. Hi,

04:15:53.699 --> 04:15:55.699
stacy randecker for the

04:15:55.734 --> 04:15:58.702
tenderloin. I believe has the
lowest percentage of car

04:15:59.738 --> 04:16:01.738
ownership of any neighborhood in

04:16:01.940 --> 04:16:03.940
san francisco and they suffer

04:16:04.442 --> 04:16:06.745
disproportionately because their
neighborhood is designed as

04:16:07.379 --> 04:16:09.379
essentially a highway

04:16:09.481 --> 04:16:12.383
interchange. You have these
massive three and five,

04:16:13.452 --> 04:16:15.452
including parking long one way

04:16:17.589 --> 04:16:19.589
streets going in in in opposite

04:16:19.924 --> 04:16:21.924
directions. The sister street

04:16:22.600 --> 04:16:24.600
whole concept it's great for

04:16:25.865 --> 04:16:27.865
throughput, but it's terrible

04:16:28.334 --> 04:16:30.334
for people. I didn't see a bike

04:16:30.369 --> 04:16:32.369
lane in there. If polk were

04:16:33.806 --> 04:16:35.806
pedestrianized, I'd get it. I'd

04:16:36.108 --> 04:16:38.108
understand, but polk is a show.

04:16:38.844 --> 04:16:40.844
Okay. It is very difficult to

04:16:41.548 --> 04:16:43.548
bike on. It is not safe and it

04:16:43.816 --> 04:16:45.816
is the only north south corridor

04:16:45.818 --> 04:16:47.818
for in in the whole that whole

04:16:48.540 --> 04:16:50.540
quadrant of the city. I mean.

04:16:50.623 --> 04:16:52.991
Yeah. Oh yeah. You gave a little
bit on battery but what are you

04:16:53.259 --> 04:16:55.259
supposed to do. I mean it's like

04:16:55.361 --> 04:16:57.361
this is not equitable. Public

04:16:57.529 --> 04:16:59.529
transit includes vanpools is an

04:16:59.733 --> 04:17:01.467
economically and environmentally
sound alternative to

04:17:01.901 --> 04:17:04.870
transportation by individual
automobiles within san

04:17:04.938 --> 04:17:06.938
francisco, travel by public

04:17:07.600 --> 04:17:08.974
transit, by bicycle and on foot
must be an attractive

04:17:10.443 --> 04:17:13.110
alternative to travel by private
automobile. This is in your

04:17:13.146 --> 04:17:15.914
transit first principles. It
goes on all the documents that

04:17:16.216 --> 04:17:18.216
are printed. Every project has

04:17:18.485 --> 04:17:21.287
this and more are emblazoned
upon it. Why aren't we adhering

04:17:22.880 --> 04:17:24.880
to it? Why are we talking about

04:17:25.158 --> 04:17:27.158
keeping parking? Why aren't we

04:17:27.193 --> 04:17:29.193
read ing and greening this

04:17:30.597 --> 04:17:32.764
entire city or closing it to
automobiles so that you don't

04:17:33.500 --> 04:17:35.500
have to do any of those things

04:17:35.669 --> 04:17:37.669
where are we going to do that?

04:17:39.273 --> 04:17:41.974
Please is thank you. Any other
speakers in the room? Okay.

04:17:44.911 --> 04:17:46.911
Please open the phone. Actually,

04:17:46.947 --> 04:17:49.882
I want to speak on the project.
Jay is not quite yet. This is

04:17:53.287 --> 04:17:55.287
the hyde street. That's item 13.

04:17:55.523 --> 04:17:57.924
Thank you. Remote public comment
at this time. We will move to

04:17:58.580 --> 04:18:00.580
remote public comment not to

04:18:00.427 --> 04:18:02.427
exceed a total time of ten

04:18:02.462 --> 04:18:04.462
minutes. Members of the public

04:18:04.531 --> 04:18:06.499
wishing to comment should dial
star three to enter the queue.

04:18:06.533 --> 04:18:08.533
each speaker will have two

04:18:09.337 --> 04:18:11.337
minutes. Moderator for speaker.

04:18:12.940 --> 04:18:14.942
Hi this is dylan faber community
and policy manager at san

04:18:14.942 --> 04:18:16.942
francisco transit riders. We

04:18:17.711 --> 04:18:19.711
support the hyde street quick

04:18:19.747 --> 04:18:21.647
build project and thank staff
for the extensive outreach

04:18:23.217 --> 04:18:25.418
that's been done to transit
riders and the tenderloin

04:18:26.921 --> 04:18:28.921
community. But we would at the

04:18:29.570 --> 04:18:31.491
same time like to see the
addition of red paint, the

04:18:32.594 --> 04:18:34.861
inclusion of transit only lanes
and a road diet on hyde street

04:18:34.962 --> 04:18:36.897
from eddy to mcallister will
improve safety and reduce

04:18:36.964 --> 04:18:38.932
conflicts on the corridor, all
while improving speed and

04:18:39.767 --> 04:18:41.901
reliability for the thousands of
riders who rely on the 19

04:18:43.605 --> 04:18:45.339
transit. Only lanes are a common
sense solution to improving

04:18:46.740 --> 04:18:48.740
transit service in our transit

04:18:48.376 --> 04:18:51.311
first city. But we're concerned
that the proposed designs

04:18:51.446 --> 04:18:53.446
presented today do not include

04:18:54.749 --> 04:18:56.883
the red paint. It's standard for
24/7 transit only lanes in san

04:18:57.885 --> 04:18:59.885
francisco to receive red paint

04:19:00.321 --> 04:19:02.356
to make it clear to drivers that
they should keep the lane clear

04:19:02.424 --> 04:19:05.126
for transit vehicles. We know
red lanes work sfmta studies

04:19:05.961 --> 04:19:07.962
have found that painting transit
lanes red can increase

04:19:09.330 --> 04:19:11.799
compliance from drivers by up to
55, even if overall overall car

04:19:12.500 --> 04:19:14.500
traffic on the road increases.

04:19:15.300 --> 04:19:17.804
So we support the swift
implementation of this project

04:19:18.390 --> 04:19:20.390
with transit only lanes added

04:19:20.142 --> 04:19:22.142
immediately as soon as possible,

04:19:22.144 --> 04:19:24.144
with or without red paint, but

04:19:24.279 --> 04:19:26.447
red paint should be added as
soon as staff capacity and

04:19:26.715 --> 04:19:28.715
resources allow. So before

04:19:29.651 --> 04:19:31.485
approving this item, the board
should direct staff to update

04:19:32.756 --> 04:19:34.756
the proposed designs to ensure

04:19:34.823 --> 04:19:37.910
that red paint is included as
part of the transit lanes. Final

04:19:37.994 --> 04:19:39.994
implementation. Thank you. Thank

04:19:45.234 --> 04:19:47.335
you. Next speaker. Hello
directors. My name is eric

04:19:48.704 --> 04:19:50.872
roselle and I'm a long term
resident of the tenderloin and

04:19:51.240 --> 04:19:53.240
the director of state programs

04:19:53.476 --> 04:19:55.510
at timberland community benefit
district and chair of the

04:19:55.845 --> 04:19:57.845
tenderloin traffic safety task

04:19:58.815 --> 04:20:01.249
force. First, I want to thank
the sfmta staff in particular

04:20:03.252 --> 04:20:05.252
jennifer and kimberly, and their

04:20:05.788 --> 04:20:07.788
hard effort in addressing our

04:20:08.924 --> 04:20:11.192
some of our questions and then
some of our concerns throughout

04:20:11.995 --> 04:20:13.995
this entire process. As jaime

04:20:14.798 --> 04:20:16.798
had stated earlier, we really do

04:20:18.401 --> 04:20:21.336
ask that the fast track, the
quick build project in its

04:20:22.400 --> 04:20:24.400
entirety from geary to market

04:20:24.740 --> 04:20:26.740
street. Second, we ask that the

04:20:26.909 --> 04:20:28.909
complete implement station of

04:20:29.179 --> 04:20:31.179
the transit only lane from eddy

04:20:32.215 --> 04:20:34.316
to market happen in tandem with
the high street transit lane

04:20:36.452 --> 04:20:38.452
project. And that number three,

04:20:39.656 --> 04:20:41.656
that the paint of the traffic

04:20:42.580 --> 04:20:44.580
only lane is red painted red

04:20:44.260 --> 04:20:46.896
from eddy to market street. That
was indicated in the first

04:20:48.980 --> 04:20:50.980
outreach extensive outreach that

04:20:50.601 --> 04:20:53.536
was done that was shown that it
would be red. It wasn't until

04:20:54.204 --> 04:20:57.600
later that it was indicated that
they would not be red and there

04:20:58.842 --> 04:21:01.900
was not extensive outreach when
that plan had been changed to

04:21:02.679 --> 04:21:05.482
inform the community in detail
that that plan had been changed.

04:21:07.518 --> 04:21:09.518
Um, and so we feel like there's

04:21:10.220 --> 04:21:12.722
been kind of a bit of switch
bait and switch going on there

04:21:15.392 --> 04:21:17.526
anyway. We also want to ensure
that transparency again does

04:21:17.728 --> 04:21:19.728
happen with the evaluation

04:21:20.931 --> 04:21:22.931
process. Thank you for your

04:21:27.304 --> 04:21:30.173
time. Thank you. Next speaker.
Can you hear me now? Yes, go

04:21:31.508 --> 04:21:33.508
ahead. Great. David pilpel,

04:21:34.445 --> 04:21:36.445
again. So on this item, I am

04:21:37.181 --> 04:21:39.181
opposed to this proposal. Hyde

04:21:39.484 --> 04:21:41.484
street feeds eighth, which is a

04:21:42.587 --> 04:21:45.222
major freeway access route in my
opinion, there is not that much

04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:48.490
transit service on this segment.

04:21:49.226 --> 04:21:51.226
The 21 hayes the 27. Bryant and

04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:53.229
golden gate transit can all be

04:21:53.698 --> 04:21:55.698
rerouted off of hyde. So that

04:21:55.967 --> 04:21:57.968
would only leave the 19 polk,
which doesn't run that

04:22:00.872 --> 04:22:02.872
frequently. Somehow I thought

04:22:03.541 --> 04:22:06.376
that capacity on hyde street was
either a condition or a

04:22:07.545 --> 04:22:09.545
mitigation measure for the van

04:22:10.181 --> 04:22:12.181
brt project or the polk street

04:22:12.884 --> 04:22:14.884
project. It's one of the few

04:22:15.954 --> 04:22:18.189
north south streets, in this
case, a southbound street that

04:22:21.426 --> 04:22:23.426
was not impacted or was not

04:22:23.862 --> 04:22:25.862
directly affected other than

04:22:27.599 --> 04:22:29.800
having additional traffic from
the van ness and polk street

04:22:30.736 --> 04:22:33.339
projects. And as I said, it
feeds eighth, which is a major

04:22:33.339 --> 04:22:35.339
freeway access route. I think

04:22:36.675 --> 04:22:38.675
that if this project is approved

04:22:39.440 --> 04:22:41.440
, this will mean more congestion

04:22:42.380 --> 04:22:45.282
and pollution on a corridor in a
neighborhood that doesn't need

04:22:47.485 --> 04:22:49.485
it. It's not my idea. But in

04:22:50.589 --> 04:22:52.824
fact, people drive people who
live in the city drive to the

04:22:53.959 --> 04:22:55.959
peninsula to drive to the east

04:22:56.695 --> 04:22:58.695
bay, need to get to a bridge and

04:22:59.198 --> 04:23:01.198
a freeway. I don't see that the

04:23:02.601 --> 04:23:04.601
benefit here outweighs the

04:23:07.140 --> 04:23:09.741
costs. 30s I am opposed to this
item. Thanks for listening.

04:23:12.411 --> 04:23:14.479
Thank you. No additional callers
. Okay, close public comment. We

04:23:14.880 --> 04:23:17.482
have a motion and a second.
Please call the roll on the

Thank you, colleagues. I'd like

04:23:36.135 --> 04:23:38.135
to given the late hour. I'd like

04:23:38.537 --> 04:23:40.739
to recommend we take item 13
next, which is an action item

04:23:41.174 --> 04:23:43.174
related to the j church project

04:23:43.977 --> 04:23:46.178
and then reevaluate if we want
to continue item 12 to the next

04:23:47.247 --> 04:23:49.448
meeting or keep going. Okay.
Very good. Thank you. Places you

04:23:49.816 --> 04:23:52.684
on item number 13 amending
transportation code division
two, section 601 to designate

04:23:54.200 --> 04:23:56.388
full time transit only areas on
san jose avenue between ocean

04:23:57.560 --> 04:23:59.250
avenue and carter street, and
approving various parking and

04:24:00.661 --> 04:24:02.661
traffic modifications include

04:24:03.730 --> 04:24:06.980
the designation of a class four
bikeway at church and market

04:24:09.803 --> 04:24:11.803
street, with staff available to

04:24:28.689 --> 04:24:30.689
present.

04:24:33.461 --> 04:24:35.461
Okay good afternoon, directors.

04:24:35.463 --> 04:24:37.664
Good evening. Whatever it is now
, my name is michael rhodes. I'm

04:24:39.300 --> 04:24:41.968
the transit priority manager in
the transit division and I'll be

04:24:42.703 --> 04:24:44.703
presenting today about proposed

04:24:45.139 --> 04:24:47.139
muni forward improvements on the

04:24:53.381 --> 04:24:55.381
j church. The j church line, the

04:24:55.850 --> 04:24:58.585
j church muni forward project is
a capital project that is split

04:24:59.453 --> 04:25:01.788
into three segments. Today. I'll
be talking about proposed

04:25:03.390 --> 04:25:05.492
upgrades at the intersection of
church and market streets and on

04:25:06.493 --> 04:25:09.196
san jose avenue in the mission
terrace neighborhood. A future

04:25:10.598 --> 04:25:13.000
phase of work will be looking at
muni forward improvements to the

04:25:14.302 --> 04:25:16.302
j church in noe valley. The

04:25:16.404 --> 04:25:18.472
project goals are to improve
safety, accessibility and

04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:23.309
comfort at church stops to

04:25:23.678 --> 04:25:26.213
address traffic safety concerns
and support reliability on the j

04:25:26.548 --> 04:25:28.548
church, as well as supporting

04:25:28.684 --> 04:25:30.684
small business and neighborhood

04:25:30.986 --> 04:25:33.120
commercial vitality, especially
at the church and market

04:25:37.250 --> 04:25:39.793
intersection at church and
market streets, thousands of

04:25:41.629 --> 04:25:43.898
people get on or off the j or 22
every day. It's also a key

04:25:44.333 --> 04:25:46.333
transfer point to church street,

04:25:46.568 --> 04:25:48.568
muni metro station below ground.

04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:50.638
And just as importantly, it's a
vital neighborhood commercial

04:25:51.640 --> 04:25:54.374
hub. We've made a series of
quick build improvements since

04:25:55.110 --> 04:25:58.120
2020 to enhance safety and
accessibility and the overall

04:25:59.314 --> 04:26:01.314
transit passenger experience. At

04:26:01.517 --> 04:26:04.218
this stop in short, we've
basically been gradually

04:26:04.320 --> 04:26:07.288
upgrading this area from a basic
transit stop to more of a

04:26:07.322 --> 04:26:09.322
transit and pedestrian plaza.

04:26:10.259 --> 04:26:12.126
And we're working on more quick
build upgrades coming soon,

04:26:12.794 --> 04:26:14.829
focused on enhancing the
transit, enhancing the actual

04:26:20.303 --> 04:26:22.304
plaza space. As you MAY recall,
this board already approved

04:26:22.672 --> 04:26:24.672
permanent transit plaza upgrades

04:26:24.940 --> 04:26:26.940
in DECEMBER 2021 at this

04:26:28.811 --> 04:26:30.978
intersection, detailed design on
the permanent plaza is underway

04:26:31.747 --> 04:26:33.848
in collaboration with public
works and local merchants and we

04:26:34.850 --> 04:26:36.850
expect construct on the

04:26:37.153 --> 04:26:39.153
permanent plaza to begin in

04:26:39.289 --> 04:26:41.990
2025. The reason we're talking
about this intersection today is

04:26:43.580 --> 04:26:45.760
to give you an update on the
design and to seek approval for

04:26:46.963 --> 04:26:48.963
a sidewalk level bikeway through

04:26:52.468 --> 04:26:54.468
the permanent plaza. Here are

04:26:54.737 --> 04:26:57.273
some of the elements that will
go into the permanent version of

04:26:59.420 --> 04:27:01.420
the plaza. There are basically

04:27:01.277 --> 04:27:03.879
two main zones in the plan
design. There's the transit

04:27:03.947 --> 04:27:06.214
passenger zone. That's kind of
where people are waiting for the

04:27:06.749 --> 04:27:08.749
train. That's kind of more to

04:27:09.218 --> 04:27:11.218
the left of the diagram here.

04:27:11.521 --> 04:27:13.723
And then a public plaza space
kind of an extension of the

04:27:15.458 --> 04:27:17.360
sidewalk right next to sort of
verve coffee and in that area

04:27:17.794 --> 04:27:19.895
there where people can drink
coffee or dine from local

04:27:21.464 --> 04:27:22.998
restaurants and basically have
high quality neighborhood

04:27:25.100 --> 04:27:27.402
gathering space. The plaza will
include a permanent, wheelchair

04:27:27.638 --> 04:27:29.706
accessible platform, um,
comfortable and welcoming

04:27:32.142 --> 04:27:35.770
transit, passenger amenities and
streetscape upgrades and seating

04:27:35.946 --> 04:27:38.848
. Church street is not a
designated bike route, but it

04:27:39.683 --> 04:27:41.817
does have a fair volume of
cyclists and we want to make

04:27:43.319 --> 04:27:45.721
sure they're not riding in the
track lane. So we're proposing

04:27:45.823 --> 04:27:48.191
to include a bike path between
the two zones. The original

04:27:48.926 --> 04:27:50.926
approval for this plaza included

04:27:51.662 --> 04:27:53.831
an exemption for bikes in terms
of the traffic restrictions, but

04:27:54.798 --> 04:27:56.798
it didn't designate it as a

04:27:57.300 --> 04:27:59.636
class four bike route. So this
is sort of an administrative

04:27:59.636 --> 04:28:01.537
clarification of what was
originally approved. So that's

04:28:03.475 --> 04:28:05.676
an update on what we're working
on at church and market. And

04:28:06.377 --> 04:28:08.612
again, the only action item for
the board for church and market

04:28:08.913 --> 04:28:10.913
is going to be to potentially

04:28:13.150 --> 04:28:15.150
adopt the proposed bikeway.

04:28:15.352 --> 04:28:17.520
Shifting south. We've also been
working on improvements to san

04:28:18.489 --> 04:28:20.723
jose avenue along the j church
in close partnership with local

04:28:21.993 --> 04:28:24.895
neighbors and supervisors. Our
safire's office there are three

04:28:25.630 --> 04:28:27.698
main challenge areas we're
looking to address with the

04:28:27.698 --> 04:28:29.698
proposed improvements on san

04:28:30.701 --> 04:28:33.503
jose. First is safety. This is a
high injury corridor and we've

04:28:34.605 --> 04:28:36.640
had extensive you know, requests
for safety improvements from

04:28:36.674 --> 04:28:38.674
neighborhood residents for many

04:28:39.211 --> 04:28:41.213
years. It's been on the radar
for a long time. There

04:28:41.213 --> 04:28:43.747
especially concerned with
speeding and safety when

04:28:45.583 --> 04:28:47.651
crossing san jose and as well as
pedestrian safety at transit

04:28:48.486 --> 04:28:50.486
stops. Second, of course,

04:28:50.522 --> 04:28:53.490
transit reliability and finally,
accessibility. There's currently

04:28:54.926 --> 04:28:57.595
a gap of almost two miles
between wheelchair accessible

04:28:58.330 --> 04:29:01.132
stops on the j church in this
area. That's from basically glen

04:29:05.770 --> 04:29:07.770
park down to balboa park. As I

04:29:08.640 --> 04:29:10.374
alluded to, there's been really
a tremendous amount of community

04:29:11.276 --> 04:29:14.450
advocacy around improving safety
for people walking in this

04:29:14.813 --> 04:29:17.515
neighborhood. On san jose avenue
about a year ago, our project

04:29:18.717 --> 04:29:20.717
team kicked off an initial round

04:29:20.719 --> 04:29:23.121
of outreach to key community
members and community based
organizations in the

04:29:23.121 --> 04:29:25.890
neighborhood who were already
kind of organized and interested

04:29:25.891 --> 04:29:28.526
in safety improvements and
knocking, knocking on our doors

04:29:29.600 --> 04:29:31.163
to have us come talk to them.
Over the past year, we've

04:29:31.163 --> 04:29:34.650
presented about potential
improvements to the local
neighborhood association, to

04:29:35.100 --> 04:29:36.634
community based organizations,
missions, to neighborhood

04:29:37.736 --> 04:29:39.736
leaders and merchants along the

04:29:40.172 --> 04:29:42.600
corridor. And this AUGUST, we
returned to the community to

04:29:43.375 --> 04:29:45.375
share a final revised proposal

04:29:46.177 --> 04:29:48.414
that incorporates a lot of the
feedback that we've heard

04:29:48.414 --> 04:29:50.415
throughout this outreach process
. Throughout the outreach, we've

04:29:50.817 --> 04:29:52.885
heard very strong support for
safety improvements and

04:29:52.885 --> 04:29:54.885
improving transit reliability.

04:29:55.755 --> 04:29:58.657
We've heard a lot of requests to
enhance the crossing experience,

04:29:59.158 --> 04:30:01.960
especially for pedestrians,
particularly along balboa park

04:30:03.529 --> 04:30:06.165
and some more localized feedback
around parking and loading

04:30:06.266 --> 04:30:08.266
needs, especially at the roxy

04:30:12.738 --> 04:30:14.738
food center at san juan avenue.

04:30:15.241 --> 04:30:17.241
So here's what we're

04:30:17.276 --> 04:30:19.276
specifically proposing on san

04:30:19.846 --> 04:30:21.846
jose avenue between to 80 and

04:30:22.248 --> 04:30:24.583
ocean avenue. First, it would be
transit lanes, which would

04:30:24.951 --> 04:30:27.753
really primarily be there to
reduce speeding while supporting

04:30:28.788 --> 04:30:31.390
transit reliability. This is
really about creating a road

04:30:32.492 --> 04:30:34.993
diet on an overbuilt roadway to
reduce speeding while keeping

04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:38.196
transit moving. So this would
reduce the roadway from four

04:30:39.399 --> 04:30:41.399
general purpose lanes, so two

04:30:42.350 --> 04:30:44.350
lanes in each direction to two

04:30:44.271 --> 04:30:46.338
total through lanes. So one lane
in each direction, vehicle is

04:30:47.474 --> 04:30:49.609
making a left turn and taxis
would still be allowed to use

04:30:50.343 --> 04:30:52.544
the left lane or the track lane
where the trains are. There

04:30:53.480 --> 04:30:55.480
would also be extended boarding

04:30:55.581 --> 04:30:57.652
islands to provide safe loading
for all train doors. Currently,

04:30:57.652 --> 04:31:00.253
some of the islands are too
short and people are stepping

04:31:01.122 --> 04:31:03.122
off into a traffic lane.

04:31:03.223 --> 04:31:06.125
Wheelchair accessible transit
stops would be added at two

04:31:06.427 --> 04:31:08.427
intersections, so four total

04:31:08.695 --> 04:31:10.695
transit stops would have

04:31:10.797 --> 04:31:12.832
wheelchair ramps added that
don't currently have them to

04:31:13.634 --> 04:31:15.936
improve accessibility and
flashing beacons, sidewalk

04:31:17.380 --> 04:31:19.307
corner bulb outs, daylighting
and left turn, traffic calming

04:31:19.307 --> 04:31:21.307
and continental crosswalk

04:31:22.276 --> 04:31:24.276
striping to improve safety for

04:31:24.879 --> 04:31:27.780
people walking as well. In
total, this project would remove

04:31:32.754 --> 04:31:34.754
a net one parking space. As I

04:31:34.956 --> 04:31:36.956
mentioned earlier, one of the

04:31:37.658 --> 04:31:40.527
key pieces of feedback we've
received has been about crossing
san jose avenue along balboa

04:31:41.462 --> 04:31:43.497
park. So this is an important
gathering space for the

04:31:44.980 --> 04:31:46.980
neighborhood. It's a major a

04:31:46.700 --> 04:31:49.269
major destination park as well.
Currently there are four

04:31:49.270 --> 04:31:51.605
intersections along the park
where people MAY cross. As you

04:31:52.107 --> 04:31:54.107
can see in this map, labeled

04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:56.144
one, two, three, four, where
currently focused on upgrading

04:31:56.144 --> 04:31:58.144
the three intersections that

04:31:58.346 --> 04:32:01.810
have existing marked crosswalks
to make these really good

04:32:01.950 --> 04:32:03.950
crossing options at havelock,

04:32:04.419 --> 04:32:06.553
santa ynez and ocean. So those
are three location that are not

04:32:06.687 --> 04:32:09.357
only intersections, but they
have a marked existing

04:32:10.259 --> 04:32:13.160
crosswalk. But we've also
received a good amount of

04:32:13.829 --> 04:32:16.797
requests to add a marked
crosswalk crossing. San jose at

04:32:17.566 --> 04:32:19.566
sergeant john young lane, which

04:32:19.801 --> 04:32:22.502
is a small park street midway
through the park. These requests

04:32:24.272 --> 04:32:26.174
came a little later in the
outreach process and we've just

04:32:26.809 --> 04:32:28.809
completed the engineering

04:32:28.911 --> 04:32:30.945
analysis in the past few days.
So in the interest of

04:32:30.979 --> 04:32:32.979
transparency and timeliness, we

04:32:33.649 --> 04:32:35.649
wanted to share an update today.

04:32:36.118 --> 04:32:38.319
Instead of waiting to get these
results out to the community a

04:32:38.487 --> 04:32:41.155
later date. For now, we're
recommending that the focus does

04:32:41.156 --> 04:32:43.156
remain on upgrading existing

04:32:43.326 --> 04:32:45.593
marked crossings to the park.
We're not currently recommending

04:32:46.962 --> 04:32:48.962
adding a marked crosswalk at

04:32:48.964 --> 04:32:50.964
sergeant john young lane based

04:32:51.400 --> 04:32:53.635
on a few key considerations.
First, there's been no recorded

04:32:53.636 --> 04:32:56.303
injury collisions at this
intersection crossing san jose

04:32:56.905 --> 04:32:58.905
in the past five years. The

04:32:59.174 --> 04:33:01.760
pedestrian volumes based on the
counts we've done are pretty

04:33:01.811 --> 04:33:03.811
low. This isn't a through

04:33:05.248 --> 04:33:07.248
street, so for most people santa

04:33:07.617 --> 04:33:09.351
ynez or ocean would be the most
direct path of travel. The

04:33:10.820 --> 04:33:12.820
closest marked crosswalk is at

04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:15.189
most about 370ft away at santa

04:33:15.324 --> 04:33:17.558
ynez, where there's a stop sign
and marked crosswalk and a j

04:33:18.328 --> 04:33:20.963
church stop and finally adding a
crosswalk here would require

04:33:21.664 --> 04:33:23.664
significant investment, such as

04:33:23.967 --> 04:33:26.134
curb ramps and flashing beacons
or a traffic signal to really

04:33:26.769 --> 04:33:29.538
make it work well, because if we
just put a crosswalk there

04:33:29.572 --> 04:33:31.840
without ramps and without some
higher visibility measures, it's

04:33:32.375 --> 04:33:34.676
not going to be a successful
crosswalk. Unfortunately, we do

04:33:35.779 --> 04:33:37.847
have limited resources and
improvements are urgently needed

04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:41.450
at a lot of other high injury
locations throughout the city.

04:33:41.518 --> 04:33:43.619
So that's why wayne, this
current safety record versus the

04:33:44.487 --> 04:33:46.989
cost of adding a crosswalk here
with signalization or with a

04:33:47.190 --> 04:33:50.125
flashing beacon and with the
curb ramps, we're recommending

04:33:50.760 --> 04:33:52.760
that we do not add a marked

04:33:52.830 --> 04:33:54.830
crosswalk at this time. But but

04:33:55.132 --> 04:33:57.767
we do understand the interest in
this crossing and will continue

04:33:58.435 --> 04:34:01.270
to monitor it and can revisit
our recommendation if conditions

04:34:07.978 --> 04:34:10.120
change on the street. So in
summary, here's what we're

04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:13.810
asking for. The board to vote on

04:34:13.517 --> 04:34:15.351
today along with the san jose
avenue corridor, we're proposing

04:34:16.860 --> 04:34:18.860
transit lanes that allow busses

04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:20.789
and taxis or that also allow

04:34:20.791 --> 04:34:22.791
left turns from ocean to carter

04:34:23.193 --> 04:34:25.193
street. A left turn must turn

04:34:25.662 --> 04:34:27.662
left northbound at ocean avenue

04:34:27.698 --> 04:34:30.434
on san jose to facilitate the
transit lane. It attended

04:34:30.434 --> 04:34:32.434
boarding islands and new

04:34:33.571 --> 04:34:35.571
accesses stops at santa ynez and

04:34:35.740 --> 04:34:37.740
santa rosa intersect ocean

04:34:38.142 --> 04:34:41.100
daylighting at san juan
paulding, santa ynez and biden

04:34:43.781 --> 04:34:46.650
and baden rather. And flashing
beacons at san juan and pauline

04:34:47.985 --> 04:34:49.986
avenues. These flashing beacons,
if you're not familiar with

04:34:51.322 --> 04:34:53.557
them, are those pushbutton signs
that you push and it lights up

04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:56.293
and says there's a pedestrian
crossing the street as well as

04:34:57.940 --> 04:34:59.950
pedestrian bulbs or sidewalk
corner extensions at paulding

04:35:00.898 --> 04:35:03.767
and baden streets at church and
market directors due to the fact

04:35:04.936 --> 04:35:06.936
that the required language for

04:35:07.104 --> 04:35:09.104
the class four bikeway was not

04:35:09.140 --> 04:35:11.208
included on the agenda for today
. We are recommending that you

04:35:12.430 --> 04:35:14.430
approve the entire item today

04:35:14.545 --> 04:35:17.415
except kept the bikeway, which
is item h, and we will bring the

04:35:17.415 --> 04:35:20.317
bikeway back for your approval
on NOVEMBER seventh. On your

04:35:21.190 --> 04:35:23.870
consent calendar, we will. We've
given you the background

04:35:24.256 --> 04:35:26.490
information on it, but we would
bring it back for approval in

04:35:29.728 --> 04:35:31.728
two weeks on the consent. And

04:35:32.630 --> 04:35:34.980
here are our proposed and next
steps. OCTOBER 17th. That's

04:35:35.733 --> 04:35:38.703
today. The sfmta board is
reviewing our proposals for san

04:35:39.304 --> 04:35:41.973
jose avenue, the class four
bikeway at church and market

04:35:42.700 --> 04:35:44.700
would be postponed for two

04:35:44.610 --> 04:35:46.944
weeks. As I mentioned, you're
going to receive an overall

04:35:47.790 --> 04:35:49.790
update about muni service today,

04:35:49.214 --> 04:35:51.480
but just to clarify, there are
no proposed changes to the

04:35:52.884 --> 04:35:54.884
church as part of this project

04:35:55.221 --> 04:35:57.221
or in general at the moment.

04:35:58.900 --> 04:36:01.590
Later this year or early next
year, we will implement the

04:36:01.527 --> 04:36:04.328
quick build phase of the project
on san jose avenue. If approved

04:36:06.198 --> 04:36:08.332
and planning and outreach, we
hope to also start for the noe

04:36:08.466 --> 04:36:11.300
valley segment. The final
segment of the j church muni

04:36:11.300 --> 04:36:13.300
forward project in that time

04:36:13.706 --> 04:36:15.741
frame over the next two years,
we would complete detailed

04:36:15.741 --> 04:36:17.741
design of transit plaza

04:36:18.100 --> 04:36:20.412
improvements and the san jose
avenue permanent version of the

04:36:21.580 --> 04:36:23.581
improvements and starting in
2025, we would start

04:36:23.783 --> 04:36:26.551
construction of full capital
elements at church and market,

04:36:27.252 --> 04:36:29.589
san jose. The whole project,
including boarding islands,

04:36:29.589 --> 04:36:31.589
flashing beacons, accessible

04:36:32.258 --> 04:36:34.526
stops, bulbs, all of the
elements that we can't complete

04:36:37.130 --> 04:36:39.130
during quick build. So so thank

04:36:39.198 --> 04:36:41.399
you very much. Directors of
course, our team is available to

04:36:42.100 --> 04:36:44.402
answer any questions you MAY
have about the proposals. Thank

04:36:46.806 --> 04:36:48.806
you, colleagues. In light of the

04:36:48.842 --> 04:36:51.760
late hour, I'm going to go to
public comment ahead of your

04:36:51.244 --> 04:36:53.846
questions. That's okay. Any
commenters in the room for the j

04:36:54.947 --> 04:36:57.249
church item? I do have some
speaker cards. Prudence hall.

04:36:57.884 --> 04:36:59.884
Hillary bao. David hooper.

04:37:01.320 --> 04:37:03.320
Samuel thomas. Go ahead. I'm

04:37:05.225 --> 04:37:07.960
hillary brown. So start comedy.
Yes, actually, my name is

04:37:09.896 --> 04:37:11.896
hillary brown. I'm with the mta.

04:37:12.999 --> 04:37:14.999
Sam m sfmta museum and

04:37:15.769 --> 04:37:17.970
accessibility committee. I've
been serving on this committee

04:37:20.440 --> 04:37:22.841
for like five years. I would
like to eventually invite to

04:37:24.111 --> 04:37:26.412
speaker, do a presentation to
the to the mac community because

04:37:28.548 --> 04:37:30.716
we want to learn about how this
project is pertaining to

04:37:31.818 --> 04:37:33.818
accessibility throughout the

04:37:35.489 --> 04:37:37.957
citizens in san francisco. I'm
wondering, I've been serving it

04:37:39.250 --> 04:37:41.861
for five years and I want to
hear about how they talk about

04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:45.198
accessibility. For example, not
just wheelchair, but people who

04:37:47.334 --> 04:37:50.236
are blind. That should be taken
consideration. I wasn't speaking

04:37:52.673 --> 04:37:54.673
that because I also wish there

04:37:57.812 --> 04:37:59.946
was a committee I think there's
a committee for the geary line,

04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:03.490
of which there were a visory

04:38:03.317 --> 04:38:06.520
committee for this project. And
if there is, I would like to

04:38:07.540 --> 04:38:09.522
serve on it. I just all I want
to say thank you for your

04:38:14.128 --> 04:38:16.128
comment. Next speaker, please.

04:38:16.364 --> 04:38:18.364
Microphone is tall. My name is

04:38:19.300 --> 04:38:21.702
prudence hall. I'm a resident of
the mission terrace and I have

04:38:24.806 --> 04:38:26.806
been meeting with sfmta for a

04:38:26.809 --> 04:38:28.809
number of years on this on this.

04:38:34.182 --> 04:38:36.182
Thank you. I am personally in

04:38:36.388 --> 04:38:39.386
favor of everything that I see
on this list. I mean, some of

04:38:39.854 --> 04:38:41.956
the items I like more than
others, but you know, hey,

04:38:42.857 --> 04:38:45.792
anything is great and we would
like them all. And I'm very

04:38:46.600 --> 04:38:48.600
disappointed. Covid that

04:38:49.465 --> 04:38:51.465
sergeant young lane was not

04:38:51.834 --> 04:38:54.602
included in this list, although
I want to really appreciate it

04:38:55.704 --> 04:38:58.606
that it's on the map now,
because when we first met with

04:39:00.675 --> 04:39:03.510
philippe and with aaron mcmullen
, it wasn't even on the map. But

04:39:06.414 --> 04:39:08.414
we have followed their

04:39:08.417 --> 04:39:10.417
suggestions at the several

04:39:11.153 --> 04:39:13.221
meetings we've had with them and
with michael jacobson of the

04:39:14.923 --> 04:39:16.924
traffic calming program. We've
pulled in our community

04:39:17.259 --> 04:39:19.259
partners. Carol jankowski, who

04:39:21.630 --> 04:39:23.630
is the area five manager for rec

04:39:23.966 --> 04:39:25.966
and park, and also now captain

04:39:26.202 --> 04:39:28.202
amy hurwitz, the captain of

04:39:28.371 --> 04:39:30.705
ingleside police station, and
she's appointed a person, sam

04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:35.750
berenson, who works with us on

04:39:35.744 --> 04:39:37.744
this. And we've asked for a

04:39:38.800 --> 04:39:40.800
crosswalk at that spot. But I do

04:39:40.182 --> 04:39:42.182
want to point out that it's not

04:39:44.287 --> 04:39:46.287
just a random road. It is the

04:39:46.289 --> 04:39:48.289
access to ingleside police

04:39:50.930 --> 04:39:52.930
station. It is the access to

04:39:52.128 --> 04:39:54.128
boxer stadium, a commercial

04:39:55.765 --> 04:39:58.700
stadium, and it is flanked by by
a children's playground. And the

04:39:59.703 --> 04:40:01.703
baseball fields. And we really

04:40:01.805 --> 04:40:04.406
need traffic calming at this t
intersection as all

04:40:05.842 --> 04:40:08.544
intersections in this section
are t intersections, not

04:40:09.646 --> 04:40:12.180
squares. Thank you for your
time. Thank you for your

04:40:16.519 --> 04:40:18.519
comment. Next speaker, please.

04:40:19.523 --> 04:40:21.523
Hello board members. My name is

04:40:21.659 --> 04:40:23.659
samuel thomas. I'm a mission

04:40:23.793 --> 04:40:26.762
terrace resident at and I live
on san jose avenue. I'm a part

04:40:27.564 --> 04:40:29.564
of the movement for a safer san

04:40:30.567 --> 04:40:32.567
jose. I have a 17 month old son

04:40:32.902 --> 04:40:34.902
who uses balboa playground and

04:40:35.720 --> 04:40:37.206
crosses the street, literally
every day. So this is a big

04:40:38.108 --> 04:40:40.877
concern for me and for other
families in our community who

04:40:41.245 --> 04:40:43.245
are in the same boat that my

04:40:43.814 --> 04:40:45.814
entire family uses the corridor

04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:50.119
and we use it regularly myself
and the community supporting
safer, san jose are very excited

04:40:51.621 --> 04:40:53.456
that this project is moving
ahead. We appreciate all the mta

04:40:54.591 --> 04:40:57.494
staff's hard work in making this
happen and in making this

04:40:58.762 --> 04:41:00.863
project a reality. We're glad
the board is listening and

04:41:01.598 --> 04:41:04.200
taking action. These are all
great things. Overall, we've

04:41:05.236 --> 04:41:07.404
heard from the majority of the
community that we've spoken with

04:41:08.710 --> 04:41:10.206
that they're pleased with the
proposal, even if it doesn't

04:41:10.541 --> 04:41:13.210
contain everything that we would
like to see, we would like for

04:41:13.377 --> 04:41:15.377
the board to approve this item

04:41:15.780 --> 04:41:17.780
today and for the mta to move

04:41:17.882 --> 04:41:19.983
immediately with the quick build
portions of the project so that

04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:22.150
we can see the situation

04:41:22.886 --> 04:41:25.588
improved as quickly as possible.
With that said, one remaining

04:41:26.230 --> 04:41:28.920
issue that has not been
addressed in addition to the

04:41:29.160 --> 04:41:31.160
crosswalk is the elimination of

04:41:31.563 --> 04:41:33.563
left turns from paulding onto

04:41:34.399 --> 04:41:36.400
san jose. This is a big problem
in the current configuration

04:41:38.169 --> 04:41:40.169
vehicles turn into a crosswalk

04:41:40.638 --> 04:41:43.473
across four lanes of traffic and
that includes transit vehicles,

04:41:43.607 --> 04:41:45.810
cars and this is extremely
dangerous and puts pedestrians

04:41:48.130 --> 04:41:50.800
in harm's way. We know it's
dangerous because our 80 year

04:41:51.216 --> 04:41:53.917
old neighbor who one of our
directors has met was struck and

04:41:55.520 --> 04:41:57.520
injured in exactly this way a

04:41:57.689 --> 04:42:00.457
little over a year ago. And he
now requires a home health aide

04:42:02.610 --> 04:42:04.295
with him most of the time. So
with that said, I think we view

04:42:05.597 --> 04:42:07.665
this project as just the
beginning, and there's still a

04:42:08.166 --> 04:42:10.568
lot more to do. We need a
comprehensive set of streetscape

04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:13.570
improvements every thing in this

04:42:13.572 --> 04:42:16.273
proposal is fantastic work. It
is a transit optimization

04:42:17.476 --> 04:42:20.110
project. We would love to have
the signals team as well as the

04:42:23.820 --> 04:42:25.917
streets team engage with us to
move things ahead. Thank you

04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:28.510
very much. Thank you. Next

04:42:32.691 --> 04:42:34.692
speaker, please. Stacy
randecker. Both these projects

04:42:36.494 --> 04:42:39.300
hit me hard because my son,
well, both my kids went to

04:42:40.132 --> 04:42:43.340
everett middle school and
because the 55 doesn't go all

04:42:44.937 --> 04:42:46.937
the way to across to church and

04:42:49.800 --> 04:42:51.876
market, we will often drive him
to church and market to catch

04:42:52.911 --> 04:42:55.460
muni to go to lowell and my
daughter started her high school

04:42:56.616 --> 04:42:58.857
career at balboa. My son played
ball on that field many, many

04:42:59.619 --> 04:43:01.586
times and I am very familiar
with the street they're talking

04:43:02.955 --> 04:43:04.955
about. And that is a desire line

04:43:04.957 --> 04:43:06.957
that is how people go to the

04:43:07.593 --> 04:43:09.160
park. And that should have at
minimum, the lousy freaking

04:43:10.930 --> 04:43:13.799
crosswalk that you have there
right now. Just stripe it. Just

04:43:14.167 --> 04:43:17.136
make it something, make it bold,
make it pretty big. I don't

04:43:18.400 --> 04:43:20.972
know. But make it so that
drivers can see it. If you can't

04:43:22.675 --> 04:43:24.409
do all of the other capital
improvements, at least apply

04:43:25.478 --> 04:43:28.112
some stinking paint. So these
people feel better and in terms

04:43:30.617 --> 04:43:33.519
of like how can you make it,
they don't read signs, they read

04:43:33.753 --> 04:43:36.689
the roads. So you can have all
the signals you want, but you've

04:43:36.923 --> 04:43:38.923
got to think about dieting it.

04:43:39.659 --> 04:43:41.593
You've got to think about taking
away some of that, that parking

04:43:42.395 --> 04:43:45.970
have the park, the rec and park
get involved. How about having

04:43:46.532 --> 04:43:48.735
tree plantings that go out that,
you know, we don't have enough

04:43:49.103 --> 04:43:51.103
street trees in our city. We

04:43:51.138 --> 04:43:53.839
must have I know we've allocated
budget for that. Can we get

04:43:54.740 --> 04:43:56.842
street trees that come out and
make these roads more narrow

04:43:58.578 --> 04:44:01.810
that take some of these parking
spaces that make it safer for

04:44:01.810 --> 04:44:03.810
people so it doesn't have to

04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:05.785
come out of sfmta's budget, but
we've got to start getting

04:44:05.953 --> 04:44:08.121
crafty about how we make these
streets safer for people all.

04:44:08.622 --> 04:44:10.622
Thank you. Thank you. Next

04:44:17.698 --> 04:44:19.698
speaker, please.

04:44:21.301 --> 04:44:23.301
My name is david hooper. I've

04:44:23.538 --> 04:44:25.538
lived in mission terrace since

04:44:26.841 --> 04:44:28.841
86. I want to throw a little

04:44:31.512 --> 04:44:33.512
cold water on this project since

04:44:33.848 --> 04:44:36.549
the line was extended in 1990,
there were no tracks on that

04:44:37.785 --> 04:44:39.785
portion of our neighborhood. The

04:44:41.220 --> 04:44:43.390
line itself, my I. I did 33
years with muni. My last 12

04:44:44.659 --> 04:44:46.659
years were at central controls,

04:44:48.749 --> 04:44:50.564
the train controller and a
manager. The line through our
community does not suffer for

04:44:53.968 --> 04:44:55.968
schedule. That's the first. The

04:44:56.537 --> 04:44:59.406
second is that it's only 12
years ago that we got the

04:45:00.875 --> 04:45:02.875
crosswalk with a stop sign at

04:45:03.611 --> 04:45:05.379
santa ynez to be able to cross
to the park. We've been beating

04:45:06.547 --> 04:45:08.615
the drum about pedestrian safety
, you know, why did the

04:45:10.785 --> 04:45:12.952
pedestrian cross the road and
we've been trying to work with

04:45:14.189 --> 04:45:16.189
this so some things are great.

04:45:18.293 --> 04:45:20.294
Improved islands, the bump outs
at the various intersections,

04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:24.765
the effort to square off for the
motorists at paulding and at

04:45:27.469 --> 04:45:30.700
baden, that hazard, the yellow
hazard lights that's like are

04:45:30.271 --> 04:45:32.271
they going to work? That has to

04:45:33.142 --> 04:45:35.810
be seen. It's a very wide street
. I saw the lights are on either

04:45:36.912 --> 04:45:38.912
side. But the big item for me is

04:45:39.314 --> 04:45:42.116
that painting the town red
painting, the transit lines. Red

04:45:45.820 --> 04:45:48.555
is it's nonsensical and the line
doesn't need it for transit at

04:45:51.394 --> 04:45:53.394
the street on either side. We

04:45:53.829 --> 04:45:55.829
have nothing but left turns. We

04:45:56.398 --> 04:45:58.398
go, it's a t, you have to make a

04:45:58.634 --> 04:46:01.435
left turn to go into the park,
to go to the police station, to

04:46:02.437 --> 04:46:04.438
go to boxer stadium, you have to
make a left turn at paulding or

04:46:04.906 --> 04:46:06.906
at baden going northbound

04:46:07.577 --> 04:46:09.477
because you are going on to a
freeway overpass coming

04:46:10.479 --> 04:46:12.981
southbound. It's the same thing.
We don't have any of the squared

04:46:13.950 --> 04:46:15.950
off intersections. The cars will

04:46:16.552 --> 04:46:19.420
still be in the red lane, the
left lane. And it's monkey see,

04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:23.390
monkey do once others do it,

04:46:23.592 --> 04:46:25.592
people will do it. I don't see

04:46:25.662 --> 04:46:27.662
the value. Thank you. Thank you.

04:46:28.399 --> 04:46:30.399
Any other speakers in the room,

04:46:30.900 --> 04:46:33.135
please open the phones at this
time we'll move to remote public

04:46:33.703 --> 04:46:35.904
comment. Not to exceed a total
time of ten minutes. Members of

04:46:36.739 --> 04:46:39.507
the public wishing to comment
should dial star three to enter

04:46:39.508 --> 04:46:41.810
the queue. Each speaker will
have two minutes. Moderator

04:46:44.781 --> 04:46:46.781
first speaker to. Great. Can you

04:46:48.317 --> 04:46:50.317
hear me now? Yes, go ahead.

04:46:50.553 --> 04:46:53.322
Great. David pilpel again. So on
this item, while there is some

04:46:54.900 --> 04:46:56.892
more discussion of stakeholder
engagement in the staff report,

04:46:57.760 --> 04:46:59.828
it just raised some additional
questions for me. If the

04:47:00.630 --> 04:47:02.630
community asks for various

04:47:02.165 --> 04:47:04.834
things, it didn't really commit
more than just, oh, we're going

04:47:05.936 --> 04:47:08.671
to, you know, maybe look into it
. So I'm I'm just concerned

04:47:09.739 --> 04:47:11.307
about the lack of meaningful
discussion about stakeholder

04:47:13.777 --> 04:47:15.777
engagement in staff reports. It

04:47:15.778 --> 04:47:18.247
is not particularly clear to me
why these changes are being

04:47:19.783 --> 04:47:21.783
pursued right now, given what

04:47:21.852 --> 04:47:23.852
staff said earlier about about

04:47:24.120 --> 04:47:27.560
staff availability and other
things. This just doesn't seem

04:47:28.580 --> 04:47:30.580
like the highest priority to me.

04:47:31.795 --> 04:47:34.663
I did hear david hooper speak a
few minutes ago and I heard him

04:47:35.767 --> 04:47:37.767
speak at the friday hearing on

04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:39.868
this that essentially that this

04:47:39.937 --> 04:47:41.937
project by itself will not

04:47:42.600 --> 04:47:44.600
improve j church reliability.

04:47:44.908 --> 04:47:46.908
And I agree with him. I think

04:47:47.644 --> 04:47:49.745
that is true. And he has a lot
of experience since as a transit

04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:52.470
supervisor for central control

04:47:52.183 --> 04:47:54.183
dispatcher, train controller

04:47:55.953 --> 04:47:58.855
manager for it seems to me that
there really are far more

04:47:59.624 --> 04:48:02.592
important priorities right now.
So I'm not sure that I would

04:48:03.494 --> 04:48:05.494
approve this particular action

04:48:05.529 --> 04:48:08.231
today as it is, staff already
said that part of this will be

04:48:08.866 --> 04:48:10.866
back at your next meeting. And I

04:48:12.771 --> 04:48:15.380
agree with the speaker a few
ahead of me that said that this

04:48:15.607 --> 04:48:17.607
really needs a comprehensive

04:48:17.709 --> 04:48:19.709
plan and this just seems like

04:48:20.311 --> 04:48:22.311
bits and pieces on the san jose

04:48:24.215 --> 04:48:26.383
avenue portion. 30s and it's a
thanks and it's a follow up

04:48:26.485 --> 04:48:28.485
piece that church and market

04:48:28.720 --> 04:48:30.720
that's somewhat inconsistent

04:48:31.623 --> 04:48:33.623
with other things that could be

04:48:33.758 --> 04:48:35.758
happening there. Bottom line is

04:48:36.610 --> 04:48:38.328
I'm not sure I would do this the
way this is currently packaged.

04:48:38.863 --> 04:48:40.863
And I think the better solution

04:48:41.733 --> 04:48:43.733
is to harness. Stacy ran

04:48:43.936 --> 04:48:45.936
decker's energy as a power

04:48:47.639 --> 04:48:50.308
source to supply power to muni
and to all of us, because I was

04:48:51.643 --> 04:48:54.211
very impressed with her passion
on this and other items. That's

04:48:55.147 --> 04:48:57.147
all. Thanks for listening. Thank

04:48:59.217 --> 04:49:01.918
you. No additional speakers.
I'll close public comment.

04:49:02.210 --> 04:49:04.210
Colleagues, I think we had a

04:49:04.690 --> 04:49:07.392
couple of questions or comments
earlier. Director kahina did you

04:49:09.962 --> 04:49:11.962
want to? Yeah speak. Of course.

04:49:12.197 --> 04:49:14.699
Well, thank you to staff and to
all the community advocates that

04:49:17.336 --> 04:49:19.336
really brought this issue to the

04:49:19.638 --> 04:49:22.507
board. I think it was last year
where where folks were really
pounding the drums to make sure

04:49:23.542 --> 04:49:25.677
that we paid close attention to
san jose avenue and to really

04:49:27.460 --> 04:49:29.460
focus on traffic calming in that

04:49:29.415 --> 04:49:31.415
in that corridor, particularly

04:49:33.652 --> 04:49:35.920
after MR. Martin's collision.
And I did have an opportunity to

04:49:37.657 --> 04:49:40.492
meet him and it was really
challenging to see how he was

04:49:41.194 --> 04:49:43.295
just still navigating the
streets, still bravely crossing

04:49:43.829 --> 04:49:46.531
the street, even though he
almost perished after that

04:49:47.967 --> 04:49:50.680
collision. And it wasn't a
fatality, but it was a hair away

04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:53.571
from being a fatality. So I just
really want to thank the

04:49:54.741 --> 04:49:56.741
community for rallying for him

04:49:58.780 --> 04:50:00.879
and for his for his safety and
for so many of the folks are

04:50:01.915 --> 04:50:03.915
elder community members in d11

04:50:05.840 --> 04:50:07.653
because we do have the highest
percentage of seniors, highest

04:50:07.653 --> 04:50:09.921
percentage of families in that
district. And so a corridor like

04:50:10.857 --> 04:50:13.920
this that serves the park, that
serves schools, it's imperative

04:50:14.594 --> 04:50:16.762
that that we are doing our
utmost to make sure it's safe

04:50:18.398 --> 04:50:21.233
for pedestrians. And so I did
have a few clarifying questions

04:50:24.604 --> 04:50:26.604
about the project itself. I did

04:50:26.706 --> 04:50:28.706
see that. So the intersection

04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:33.946
where MR. Martin was was hit was
on paulding and san jose. And so

04:50:35.516 --> 04:50:38.500
I appreciate that we are looking
at some solutions there,

04:50:38.952 --> 04:50:40.952
particularly the rapid flashing

04:50:42.389 --> 04:50:44.389
beacons. And I do see that

04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:47.928
within the I guess like the many
options of treatments there. We

04:50:48.396 --> 04:50:50.396
also have left turn traffic

04:50:51.866 --> 04:50:54.500
calming as one of the pieces
that we're considering
implementing throughout that

04:50:56.700 --> 04:50:58.700
corridor. Why are we not

04:51:01.542 --> 04:51:03.542
implementing it there? Thank you

04:51:05.700 --> 04:51:08.381
. So the challenge at paulding,
unfortunately, is that there
isn't the street space basically

04:51:11.719 --> 04:51:14.422
to add the additional space that
you'd need to put the left turn

04:51:14.422 --> 04:51:17.190
traffic calming. It's basically
a, you know, it's posts in the

04:51:18.726 --> 04:51:21.940
street or kind of a space in the
street that that folks people to

04:51:24.765 --> 04:51:26.765
make a wider turn at at at a at

04:51:27.802 --> 04:51:30.771
at baden there is space there is
extra lane space but at paulding

04:51:30.972 --> 04:51:32.972
the lanes are really you know

04:51:33.441 --> 04:51:35.542
basically as narrow as you can
make them without squeezing in.

04:51:35.776 --> 04:51:38.212
There's not really room to
squeeze in that kind of traffic

04:51:38.212 --> 04:51:40.347
calming. We can certainly, you
know, sharpen our pencils and

04:51:41.249 --> 04:51:44.180
look back at it. It doesn't it's
not really a legislative change.

04:51:44.485 --> 04:51:46.820
It's a project feature, but it's
not something that requires an

04:51:48.560 --> 04:51:50.290
approval per se. But we can you
know, we can certainly take

04:51:51.392 --> 04:51:53.493
another look and see if there's
anything else we can do to

04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:56.163
further support that. Yeah, I
think that's it's critical,

04:51:56.163 --> 04:51:58.132
especially like paulding and
baden specifically. There there

04:51:59.434 --> 04:52:02.136
are ways that folks from the
monterey boulevard or that that

04:52:03.338 --> 04:52:05.338
particular neighborhood connect

04:52:05.373 --> 04:52:08.750
to san jose then get on the
freeway or cross into other

04:52:09.177 --> 04:52:11.945
neighborhoods. And so it's a
they're both like feeder streets

04:52:14.250 --> 04:52:15.850
to the freeway. And so it's I
think it's super important for

04:52:16.685 --> 04:52:18.685
those streets in particular to

04:52:19.588 --> 04:52:21.889
get the most amount of
treatments as possible because

04:52:24.920 --> 04:52:26.920
folks are usually speeding to

04:52:26.662 --> 04:52:28.662
get across those streets at the

04:52:30.365 --> 04:52:32.567
other street that came to mind
and I appreciate all the public

04:52:33.236 --> 04:52:35.236
comment on this too, because

04:52:35.972 --> 04:52:37.972
it's I think it's merited.

04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:41.410
Sergeant john v young lane so I

04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:43.110
understand. And that you all did

04:52:43.178 --> 04:52:45.178
a study, so I appreciate you

04:52:46.382 --> 04:52:48.382
doing the study. But you know, I

04:52:48.584 --> 04:52:51.386
know the street very well. A lot
of folks there's a there's a

04:52:52.889 --> 04:52:55.724
parking area for folks that
frequent the park and it's cars

04:52:57.293 --> 04:53:00.195
are often going there like
frequently just to find parking

04:53:01.300 --> 04:53:03.300
to access the park, to go to the

04:53:03.399 --> 04:53:05.399
police station to use the

04:53:06.203 --> 04:53:08.470
diamond ring, like all these
different activations that are

04:53:10.306 --> 04:53:12.306
that the park has. And this is

04:53:12.542 --> 04:53:14.542
one of the few parking areas is

04:53:14.544 --> 04:53:17.245
in that park. And so there are
always cars going through there

04:53:18.281 --> 04:53:20.382
at various speeds, even though
there's a police station right

04:53:21.851 --> 04:53:23.851
there. It's really interesting

04:53:24.321 --> 04:53:26.321
and so curious why why we're not

04:53:26.523 --> 04:53:29.910
proposing something there more
substantial to create a safer

04:53:31.428 --> 04:53:33.428
passage for pedestrians. There

04:53:34.330 --> 04:53:36.330
yeah. And to your point, that is

04:53:36.833 --> 04:53:39.501
a busy well, you know, it has it
has activity. People accessing

04:53:40.360 --> 04:53:42.973
the park and the one collision
that we do have in the past five

04:53:42.973 --> 04:53:45.700
years at that intersection is
actually somebody walking along

04:53:47.770 --> 04:53:49.812
san jose crossing sergeant john
young lane. So it's, you know,

04:53:49.946 --> 04:53:52.181
in that crosswalk where they're
crossing, sergeant john young

04:53:54.651 --> 04:53:56.852
versus crossing san jose and so
we will be upgrading that

04:53:57.253 --> 04:53:59.253
crosswalk from a kind of

04:53:59.790 --> 04:54:02.325
traditional kind of two lines
kind of crosswalk to a

04:54:03.930 --> 04:54:05.395
continental crosswalk to improve
the visibility. We've also so

04:54:06.530 --> 04:54:09.332
the that that intersection has
full daylighting at this point

04:54:10.400 --> 04:54:12.535
to increase the visibility
there. But in terms of the

04:54:12.636 --> 04:54:15.504
collision history, what we've
seen is really just that one

04:54:15.605 --> 04:54:17.942
collision. That was somebody
crossing john v young and it

04:54:17.942 --> 04:54:19.942
speaks to what you mentioned,

04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:22.110
which is that there is activity

04:54:22.146 --> 04:54:24.280
of people kind of driving in and
out of sergeant john young.

04:54:24.381 --> 04:54:27.150
There are people crossing in.
John young, so certainly we want

04:54:28.180 --> 04:54:30.887
to make sure that's as visible
as possible. So again, like I

04:54:31.789 --> 04:54:33.789
think we really need to explore

04:54:33.925 --> 04:54:35.925
for making crossing across san

04:54:38.329 --> 04:54:40.464
jose, whether we're exploring it
or studying whatever it is. But

04:54:41.466 --> 04:54:43.500
I do think we need some
intervention there and I feel

04:54:44.468 --> 04:54:46.602
quite passionate about it
considering I think also the

04:54:46.871 --> 04:54:49.506
members of the public also
talked about this too. So there

04:54:50.574 --> 04:54:52.743
are tons of families that get
serviced by that intersection.

04:54:54.245 --> 04:54:56.480
And I just I see it as as a MISS
If we're not really paying close

04:54:57.415 --> 04:54:59.583
attention to how that that
particular intersection can be

04:55:02.320 --> 04:55:04.888
safer. And I don't want to wait
for a collision to happen to

04:55:07.970 --> 04:55:09.236
make the call. So I would
encourage staff to really

04:55:10.280 --> 04:55:12.863
explore that thoroughly. If
we're true to our visions or

04:55:14.332 --> 04:55:16.332
goals, the other piece, let's

04:55:20.405 --> 04:55:22.573
see if I want to let me see. I
think those were the two main

04:55:24.476 --> 04:55:26.476
pieces that I wanted to bring

04:55:26.879 --> 04:55:29.414
forth to the board, and I know
there is quite a lot of energy

04:55:30.516 --> 04:55:32.516
for folks to eliminate left

04:55:33.318 --> 04:55:35.720
turns on paulding. But I can
understand why why that's

04:55:37.155 --> 04:55:39.223
something that the I don't know
if you all want to explain that

04:55:40.792 --> 04:55:42.993
a little bit more, why we opted
not to eliminate left turns.

04:55:43.729 --> 04:55:46.631
There yeah, it mostly comes down
to the street grid in that

04:55:46.732 --> 04:55:49.667
neighborhood. There's only a few
streets that actually cross to

04:55:49.935 --> 04:55:52.904
80. It's not a regular street
grid where streets go through.

04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:56.240
There's not a lot of full kind
of four leg intersections. So

04:55:57.676 --> 04:55:59.877
when you restrict the left turn
there, it's not like the mission

04:55:59.945 --> 04:56:02.482
or somewhere where you might
just make or downtown where you

04:56:02.482 --> 04:56:05.830
might make three rights to be
able to access your destination.

04:56:05.318 --> 04:56:07.318
It requires a lot more foresight

04:56:07.720 --> 04:56:10.456
to know, oh, I guess I need to
turn left here and turn right

04:56:10.456 --> 04:56:12.557
there and if you MISS Your
opportunity to do that, you're

04:56:13.225 --> 04:56:15.426
kind of in a tricky spot and
there is a commercial corridor

04:56:15.794 --> 04:56:18.363
immediately north of paulding
that we want to make sure people

04:56:18.998 --> 04:56:20.998
can access and not make that too

04:56:23.800 --> 04:56:25.837
difficult for the small
businesses that are there. So
those are the primary
considerations. We, you know, we
like restricting lefts in some

04:56:26.139 --> 04:56:28.139
cases to preserve safety or

04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:30.708
protect safety and keep transit

04:56:30.943 --> 04:56:33.440
moving. But this is one location
where we think the circulation

04:56:33.646 --> 04:56:35.646
was a little bit bigger

04:56:37.517 --> 04:56:40.850
consideration. And just to state
my position on this, I fully

04:56:40.987 --> 04:56:42.987
support this project. Of course,

04:56:44.958 --> 04:56:47.920
I want more on that street. This
is a neighborhood that doesn't

04:56:47.694 --> 04:56:49.861
really get its due, its
investments. And so I appreciate

04:56:50.290 --> 04:56:52.290
the level of effort and care

04:56:52.980 --> 04:56:54.967
that the team went through to
make sure that they were
connecting with all the members

04:56:56.436 --> 04:56:58.738
of the public. And I understand
that not everyone got 100% what

04:56:59.500 --> 04:57:01.500
they wanted, but this is close

04:57:02.342 --> 04:57:04.443
enough for me to support this.
Thank you. Vice chair cajina

04:57:07.514 --> 04:57:09.514
director. So and thank you for

04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:12.619
the presentation. I like a lot
of the graphics and I'm trying

04:57:13.520 --> 04:57:15.355
to make it brief because it's
like 6:00. I just to really two

04:57:17.900 --> 04:57:19.900
questions. I love that balboa

04:57:19.493 --> 04:57:21.493
park playground and also my

04:57:21.995 --> 04:57:24.964
daughter's always go there now
practicing various different

04:57:25.565 --> 04:57:27.565
kind of sports. So I'm just

04:57:29.737 --> 04:57:31.737
curious of why you chose to have

04:57:33.641 --> 04:57:35.641
a stop sign on santa ines

04:57:36.210 --> 04:57:38.210
crosswalk. Whereas you know, on

04:57:38.879 --> 04:57:40.879
the sergeant john vision, you

04:57:41.615 --> 04:57:43.615
just have a no mark crosswalk.

04:57:44.485 --> 04:57:46.887
Yes. Thank where? I'm sorry.
That's actually where exactly

04:57:48.623 --> 04:57:51.358
all the parents would go with
their three year old toddler
that's like that would be the

04:57:52.393 --> 04:57:55.228
one they will cross. Yeah.
Totally understand the question.

04:57:55.897 --> 04:57:58.640
As a parent of a three year old
toddler, I totally get that. But

04:57:59.300 --> 04:58:01.367
the main there's kind of a
couple main reasons, one of

04:58:01.368 --> 04:58:04.700
which is that sergeant john v
young does not continue as a

04:58:06.441 --> 04:58:08.441
street once it crosses san jose.

04:58:09.677 --> 04:58:12.212
So the only kind of case where
sergeant john v young would be

04:58:13.114 --> 04:58:15.250
your most direct path of travel
is if you were located

04:58:16.450 --> 04:58:19.190
immediately be kind of to the
east of it's not a through

04:58:19.530 --> 04:58:21.923
street, whereas santa ynez is a
through street that, you know,

04:58:22.691 --> 04:58:25.626
kind of circulates into the
neighborhood. Santa ynez is also

04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:28.863
the location of a j church stop.
So that's where people are

04:58:29.640 --> 04:58:31.640
getting on and off the train.

04:58:31.633 --> 04:58:33.267
And we want to make sure that's
safe, accessible place to have a

04:58:34.903 --> 04:58:37.404
stop sign. So those are you
know, it's that circulation

04:58:37.805 --> 04:58:39.805
element and it's the it's the

04:58:41.710 --> 04:58:43.710
train stop. So is it too much to

04:58:44.460 --> 04:58:46.460
ask for having that? Number

04:58:46.548 --> 04:58:48.649
three, you have that blue dot
there to actually have some sort

04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:52.510
of flashing on the marking on

04:58:52.821 --> 04:58:55.550
the street? I just want to make
sure that we don't have another

04:58:55.992 --> 04:58:57.992
our toddler got run over by a

04:58:58.600 --> 04:59:00.600
car and killed. So. Absolutely.

04:59:00.829 --> 04:59:03.665
So most of the time we will take
the shortest cut because kids,

04:59:04.833 --> 04:59:07.301
we just want to get them to the
playground as quick as as

04:59:08.203 --> 04:59:10.404
possible. And you know, I mean,
like, you know, that's that's

04:59:12.140 --> 04:59:14.140
the you know, can we do that?

04:59:14.844 --> 04:59:17.812
You know, I get that completely.
So the reason that we made the

04:59:19.282 --> 04:59:22.170
recommendation is that if we are
going to mark this as a

04:59:22.353 --> 04:59:25.186
crosswalk and say this is a
place you should cross this, you

04:59:25.556 --> 04:59:27.556
know, right now what the street

04:59:27.656 --> 04:59:29.890
tells you is you should cross at
santa ynez or at ocean because

04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:32.528
those are marked crosswalks.
They have a signal or they have

04:59:33.463 --> 04:59:36.231
a stop sign. They have the
infrastructure that sort of
invites you to cross. Right now,

04:59:38.101 --> 04:59:40.101
if we were to add a crosswalk at

04:59:40.102 --> 04:59:42.102
at at sergeant john v young,

04:59:42.738 --> 04:59:45.600
we'd really want to add more
than just a crosswalk because as

04:59:47.141 --> 04:59:49.770
we've seen at other places along
the corridor, once you have a
basic crosswalk, that's not

04:59:49.812 --> 04:59:51.914
enough by itself, right? So we
would probably need to do a

04:59:52.782 --> 04:59:55.510
flashing beacon. We definitely
need to do curb ramps which

04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:57.953
don't exist currently. We might
need to do bulbs to really make

04:59:58.487 --> 05:00:00.556
it work well or a signal, you
know, there's all these

05:00:00.556 --> 05:00:02.591
additional infrastructure
pieces. So it isn't necessarily

05:00:03.760 --> 05:00:06.695
a decision between nothing and a
little bit. It's sort of like,

05:00:07.798 --> 05:00:09.799
do we make a significant
investment in this intersection,

05:00:10.834 --> 05:00:13.602
which, you know, isn't a through
street, doesn't have high
pedestrian volumes right now,

05:00:14.571 --> 05:00:17.600
right now, our recommendation is
to channel people to that, that

05:00:18.740 --> 05:00:20.740
nearest intersection 350ft away.

05:00:21.440 --> 05:00:23.440
But we understand that, you know

05:00:23.747 --> 05:00:25.848
, if you're trying to get across
the street, there's the

05:00:26.116 --> 05:00:28.985
playground, just get out of your
car. We get it. I totally get

05:00:29.520 --> 05:00:31.354
it. That that's that's an
attractive place to cross. So I

05:00:32.322 --> 05:00:34.557
would just weigh, you know, this
is a location with no injuries.

05:00:35.158 --> 05:00:37.158
We have a lot of locations in

05:00:37.594 --> 05:00:40.563
the city with high numbers of
injuries that could use that
same investment. It would

05:00:40.630 --> 05:00:43.466
probably be, you know, $600,000
or so to make the kind of basic

05:00:44.568 --> 05:00:46.568
curb ramps, flashing beacons and

05:00:48.380 --> 05:00:50.541
striping that, you know, a lot
of other intersections have

05:00:50.541 --> 05:00:52.775
competing needs. But that's
that's sort of a policy choice

05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:55.951
to weigh. And that's why we made
our recommendation. But it's

05:00:56.246 --> 05:00:58.246
not, you know, it's something to

05:00:59.751 --> 05:01:02.486
consider. So because it was
going to cost a lot of money. So

05:01:04.121 --> 05:01:06.121
how about you combine the two? I

05:01:06.691 --> 05:01:08.658
move the bus stop or move that
number two point that you have.

05:01:10.327 --> 05:01:13.263
I'm just trying to I'm just
trying to say that can we solve

05:01:13.397 --> 05:01:16.366
of a lot of problems with one
resources that we have like move

05:01:18.236 --> 05:01:20.236
the number two and three

05:01:21.272 --> 05:01:23.273
together. I think if we were to
do that, there would still be

05:01:23.942 --> 05:01:26.430
the desire to cross at the
existing streets and we'd still

05:01:26.344 --> 05:01:28.344
have requests for crossings so

05:01:29.247 --> 05:01:31.681
that would be my concern with
that. That is kind of

05:01:33.685 --> 05:01:35.685
unfortunate. Yeah, it's really

05:01:37.222 --> 05:01:40.157
unfortunate. My other question
is that you mentioned about that

05:01:43.361 --> 05:01:45.361
bike path of travel on on the

05:01:46.297 --> 05:01:48.297
other side of town. Now, bike

05:01:49.133 --> 05:01:51.133
path of travel is going to have

05:01:53.720 --> 05:01:55.720
to go through some review. It's

05:01:55.274 --> 05:01:57.308
not even that it's simpler. We
just literally there's some

05:01:57.375 --> 05:01:59.375
additional sql related language

05:02:00.779 --> 05:02:03.480
that should go on the agenda
that's posted for the board of

05:02:04.415 --> 05:02:07.217
directors and the item itself
was listed, but it should have

05:02:07.585 --> 05:02:09.420
said some language about this
being an approval action under

05:02:10.156 --> 05:02:12.690
sequa. Et cetera. So it's just a
noticing issue. It's not a

05:02:14.193 --> 05:02:16.193
review or anything else. Do you

05:02:16.695 --> 05:02:18.596
mind then explain to me where
does it start and where does it

05:02:19.631 --> 05:02:21.631
end? Sure. I only see the little

05:02:21.700 --> 05:02:23.700
highlight photo shop color block

05:02:25.237 --> 05:02:27.237
on the map. Yes. So it would be

05:02:27.440 --> 05:02:29.440
basically from, um, market

05:02:30.276 --> 05:02:32.410
street, which is kind of the
north end of the transit stop.

05:02:33.179 --> 05:02:35.314
And it would travel through the
transit stop shop and then it

05:02:35.314 --> 05:02:37.314
would stop sort of mid-block

05:02:38.550 --> 05:02:41.420
through the market to 15th
street block of church,

05:02:41.420 --> 05:02:43.420
basically just getting people

05:02:43.423 --> 05:02:46.225
through to the, the boarding
area, you know, because after

05:02:46.626 --> 05:02:48.626
that, there's a second lane of

05:02:48.861 --> 05:02:51.396
traffic that bikes can use. But
through this transit stop area,

05:02:51.531 --> 05:02:53.965
there's just nowhere else for
bikes to go other than into the

05:02:54.100 --> 05:02:56.100
track lane. So it's probably,

05:02:56.102 --> 05:02:58.102
you know, 300, 400ft, halfway

05:02:59.405 --> 05:03:02.410
through the lock. And it's it
doesn't continue into a bike

05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:04.143
route. It's not really a street
that we're trying to channelize

05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:07.110
bikes to, but we know that there

05:03:08.448 --> 05:03:10.582
are you know, 60 to 100 bikes
per hour that use this route

05:03:10.984 --> 05:03:12.984
because it's flat and there's
restaurants and there's places

05:03:13.286 --> 05:03:15.286
to go. So we need to basically

05:03:15.721 --> 05:03:18.356
we feel like we need to give
them somewhere safe to get
through that transit plaza.

05:03:19.526 --> 05:03:21.660
There's no bump or anything.
It's just the grade level is the

05:03:23.330 --> 05:03:25.330
same currently. We would propose

05:03:26.660 --> 05:03:28.767
it to be at sidewalk level just
to kind of make the plaza feel

05:03:28.902 --> 05:03:31.436
more like a continuous space.
There would be there would be

05:03:32.305 --> 05:03:35.140
kind of truncated domes or, you
know, like things on the street.

05:03:35.308 --> 05:03:37.810
So if your vision impaired or
have other, you know, just so

05:03:39.120 --> 05:03:41.130
that because it's flush, we want
people to know where the bike

05:03:42.516 --> 05:03:44.850
lane begins. But it would be at
the same level as the rest of

05:03:45.786 --> 05:03:48.654
the plaza. So when the bike get
off of this path of travel, they

05:03:50.690 --> 05:03:53.425
will they will need to have like
a little curb cut or something

05:03:53.928 --> 05:03:56.729
to kind of make sure they're
safe to get off. Yes, there

05:03:57.970 --> 05:03:59.970
would be a ramp at the beginning

05:03:59.700 --> 05:04:02.468
and end of it. Okay that answers
my question because I was like,

05:04:02.770 --> 05:04:04.770
well, this is doesn't look very

05:04:06.607 --> 05:04:09.141
safe for cyclists. You would do
you would make sure that they

05:04:10.410 --> 05:04:12.410
don't end up ran into these

05:04:13.981 --> 05:04:15.981
little ram edges, right? Yes

05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:18.285
they would have a ramp that
would meet our standards in

05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:21.721
terms of the you know, how
quickly it goes up and down for

05:04:22.723 --> 05:04:24.723
bikes. Okay. All right. Thank

05:04:24.725 --> 05:04:26.859
you. I would really highly,
strongly encourage you to really

05:04:27.996 --> 05:04:30.931
consider doing something more to
mark that crosswalk to the

05:04:33.267 --> 05:04:35.267
balboa playground. If you can.

05:04:37.905 --> 05:04:40.173
Thank you. Thank you, director.
So, director util, I will make

05:04:41.676 --> 05:04:43.843
this very, very quick. It is
about the plaza. I believe we

05:04:44.678 --> 05:04:46.781
talked about it almost four
years ago. Is that right?

05:04:48.650 --> 05:04:50.650
DECEMBER 20, 21, three. Two

05:04:50.952 --> 05:04:53.854
years ago. So I'm just a little
it says here that it will begin

05:04:54.689 --> 05:04:56.689
construction in 2025, which is

05:04:56.791 --> 05:04:58.791
over a year from now. And that

05:05:00.595 --> 05:05:02.595
intersection is suffering a lot.

05:05:02.597 --> 05:05:04.597
I pass by it every single week

05:05:05.000 --> 05:05:07.000
and there are a lot of that side

05:05:07.502 --> 05:05:10.271
of the street. There's been a
lot of closed businesses.
There's trash everywhere. It

05:05:10.472 --> 05:05:13.173
looks very junior varsity right
now. And I'm a little worried

05:05:14.776 --> 05:05:17.745
that we're saying it will be
another year and three months
before we even begin

05:05:18.412 --> 05:05:20.614
construction. And I don't see an
actual timeline for completing

05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:24.850
construction. So one, why can't
we start construction
construction sooner? And two,

05:05:24.119 --> 05:05:26.119
how long do you think

05:05:26.321 --> 05:05:28.321
construction will take? Right.

05:05:29.257 --> 05:05:32.159
So the that it doesn't that the
treatment we have right there

05:05:32.394 --> 05:05:35.362
right now is not abetting the
neighborhood like junior varsity

05:05:36.665 --> 05:05:38.866
is a good sports metaphor for
the current situation out there.

05:05:39.235 --> 05:05:41.235
Yeah, it's we've been kind of

05:05:41.370 --> 05:05:43.738
iterating on it. We added some
some paint to kind of claim the

05:05:43.939 --> 05:05:45.939
space and clarify where the

05:05:46.175 --> 05:05:48.643
plaza is. But totally agree with
you. We don't want to wait till

05:05:49.378 --> 05:05:51.546
20, 25 to make any kind of
improvements. The next step

05:05:52.581 --> 05:05:55.249
would be another phase of quick
build that would be really
focused on supporting the

05:05:55.818 --> 05:05:58.420
businesses. And we want to we're
working to partner with pwd and

05:06:00.723 --> 05:06:02.723
the local castro business

05:06:03.559 --> 05:06:06.610
district to activate that space
to get it, you know, to get

05:06:06.162 --> 05:06:09.640
better parklets out there, to
get the kind of near term

05:06:09.865 --> 05:06:12.433
activation we can. We think this
is stuff that we could do in a

05:06:12.701 --> 05:06:15.337
matter of months versus waiting
till 2025. Does that look like

05:06:15.438 --> 05:06:18.400
just like filling it out with
something that isn't like dirty

05:06:18.107 --> 05:06:20.509
white paint, like concrete or
even like a some kind of

05:06:20.877 --> 05:06:23.578
temporary structure? It could be
seating, landscaping, some kind

05:06:23.846 --> 05:06:26.548
of programing. So you're saying
that you're you're planning on

05:06:26.682 --> 05:06:29.551
doing that in the next few
months? That's what we're
working towards right now. We

05:06:30.319 --> 05:06:32.254
you know, as as sort of came up
during an earlier discussion,

05:06:33.560 --> 05:06:35.925
ideally mta sets the safe
traffic conditions and we

05:06:35.926 --> 05:06:38.270
partner with a local
organization that can operate

05:06:39.929 --> 05:06:41.929
some of the, you know, the

05:06:42.398 --> 05:06:44.398
seating or the, you know, the

05:06:44.667 --> 05:06:47.369
other elements that kind of make
it a great space from a

05:06:47.403 --> 05:06:50.306
pedestrian plaza standpoint. But
we are reaching out right now to

05:06:51.808 --> 05:06:54.543
take those steps and partner and
then completing the final, final

05:06:55.445 --> 05:06:57.445
plaza with everything in the

05:06:58.481 --> 05:07:00.683
permanent way you said begins in
2025. How long is that supposed

05:07:01.318 --> 05:07:03.318
to take? When will it be done?

05:07:03.720 --> 05:07:06.423
So the overall project, we
expect that to be a two year

05:07:06.457 --> 05:07:08.457
construction time frame for the

05:07:08.526 --> 05:07:10.660
whole j line corridor. But I
would expect that the plaza

05:07:11.462 --> 05:07:13.462
would not take as long as the
overall project. It will

05:07:13.831 --> 05:07:15.965
probably be one of the first
things that we work on, given

05:07:17.668 --> 05:07:19.635
the you know, it might even
happen simultaneously with san

05:07:21.738 --> 05:07:23.840
jose. So probably you know,
hopefully under a year. Okay.

05:07:25.976 --> 05:07:27.976
Then my final thing is just as I

05:07:28.279 --> 05:07:31.214
know we're working on a lot with
muni forward, just don't forget
this intersection because it's

05:07:32.116 --> 05:07:34.484
been such a tough one for some
of these small businesses. We

05:07:34.518 --> 05:07:37.219
just had another small business
open just like 2 or 3 months

05:07:37.287 --> 05:07:39.388
ago, and it's such a like
delicate, delicate ecosystem

05:07:40.224 --> 05:07:42.292
right now. And I really want to
protect it. Those business

05:07:43.600 --> 05:07:45.929
owners who are trying to make it
and I do think our treatment

05:07:46.831 --> 05:07:48.999
right now is hurting them
because it feels very abandoned.

05:07:50.701 --> 05:07:53.503
And so thank you for trying to
come up with a short term and a

05:07:54.805 --> 05:07:56.805
long term solution for it. Okay

05:07:57.740 --> 05:07:59.740
do we have a motion to approve

05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:02.790
the item? Motion to approve a
second. Second, please call the

05:08:03.181 --> 05:08:05.181
roll. I do want to clarify that

05:08:05.850 --> 05:08:07.851
you do as staff suggested, you
amend that resolution to

05:08:10.188 --> 05:08:12.756
indicate that items a through g
striking item h for the class

05:08:12.824 --> 05:08:14.824
four bikeway, which will come

05:08:15.394 --> 05:08:17.495
back to you at a future meeting
and remove the associated

05:08:17.863 --> 05:08:19.863
language from the first resolve

05:08:21.699 --> 05:08:23.699
clause for the bikeway. Can I

05:08:23.768 --> 05:08:25.768
presume that is the motion?

05:08:25.804 --> 05:08:28.505
Okay, great. Thank you. All
right. On that motion and

05:08:29.407 --> 05:08:31.407
amendment, director hemminger

05:08:31.409 --> 05:08:34.245
hemminger, director henderson
henderson. Director hinsey

05:08:35.614 --> 05:08:37.614
hinsey director. So I. So I.

05:08:40.886 --> 05:08:43.854
Director yaguchi I director ina
I kahina. I chair. Ekin I ekin.

05:08:44.122 --> 05:08:46.824
I thank you that motion passes.
Okay colleagues, we have one

05:08:47.250 --> 05:08:49.393
more item. The media service
update we've considered pushing

05:08:49.961 --> 05:08:52.130
it to the next meeting, but we
have a packed agenda for next

05:08:53.232 --> 05:08:55.733
meeting and we now have to take
hays street again at the next

05:08:56.301 --> 05:08:58.301
meeting. Thank you. Director

05:08:59.872 --> 05:09:01.939
yekutiel. And what was that
about appreciating you at the

05:09:03.242 --> 05:09:05.242
next meeting? I'm just kidding.

05:09:06.678 --> 05:09:09.247
So I would like to go ahead if
it's okay with staff and go

05:09:09.449 --> 05:09:11.449
ahead and take that presentation

05:09:11.751 --> 05:09:13.751
now. So very good. Item 12

05:09:13.953 --> 05:09:15.953
presentation and discussion

05:09:19.592 --> 05:09:21.592
regarding fema update. Right

05:09:21.827 --> 05:09:23.827
good afternoon. Slash evening.

05:09:24.196 --> 05:09:26.898
So we'll keep this fast. So but
do have some great news to

05:09:28.301 --> 05:09:30.936
share. So thank you for allowing
us the chance to address you

05:09:32.772 --> 05:09:35.307
today. So sean kennedy I'm the
senior manager for the transit

05:09:37.977 --> 05:09:40.780
planning group at the mta. My
staff has already handled most

05:09:40.312 --> 05:09:42.312
of the difficult discussions

05:09:43.216 --> 05:09:45.500
today. So I'll just get to talk
about good news. Basically, we

05:09:46.822 --> 05:09:48.787
want to go over where we're at
with the service restoration and

05:09:49.589 --> 05:09:52.458
talk through some really great
trends that we're seeing both in

05:09:53.827 --> 05:09:56.610
ridership and customer feedback
and then talk about kind of next

05:09:57.263 --> 05:10:00.165
steps and where we're going over
the next several years. So I

05:10:02.936 --> 05:10:04.936
guess with that, oh, one other

05:10:05.706 --> 05:10:08.407
thing before I get going. You
know, a really good transit

05:10:08.975 --> 05:10:11.944
system has is great transit
priority and great service

05:10:12.120 --> 05:10:14.847
planning put on top of each
other, complimentary hand in

05:10:15.515 --> 05:10:18.117
hand. So I will be today I'm
focusing just on service, but

05:10:19.653 --> 05:10:21.587
we'll be coming back at the
second meeting in NOVEMBER to

05:10:21.755 --> 05:10:23.755
talk through a muni forward

05:10:24.892 --> 05:10:27.590
update as well. So with that,
you know, with the support of

05:10:27.761 --> 05:10:29.761
this amazing board, we've really

05:10:30.430 --> 05:10:32.430
become national leaders and

05:10:32.532 --> 05:10:34.532
looking at changing ridership

05:10:34.668 --> 05:10:36.770
patterns and how to adjust and
adjust and change for that

05:10:37.738 --> 05:10:40.440
growth. And over the next two
years, we're going to have the

05:10:40.474 --> 05:10:42.474
opportunity to get even better

05:10:44.478 --> 05:10:46.478
at those skills. So we are

05:10:46.647 --> 05:10:48.647
really focusing on quality of

05:10:48.682 --> 05:10:50.682
service. That's kind of our our

05:10:51.351 --> 05:10:53.553
key metric these days. And what
we mean by that is a fast,

05:10:56.423 --> 05:10:58.423
frequent, clean, clean, safe and

05:11:00.161 --> 05:11:03.129
reliable service. We have been
focusing you see the five

05:11:03.164 --> 05:11:05.966
bullets on the on the screen in
front of you. You know, we could

05:11:07.535 --> 05:11:10.503
go into ad nauseum detail on a
number of topics and projects
that are addressing those

05:11:11.106 --> 05:11:13.307
different bullets. I do want to
highlight three real quick just

05:11:14.609 --> 05:11:16.410
to give you a taste of what kind
of stuff we're doing to address

05:11:17.812 --> 05:11:19.812
this quality quality of service

05:11:20.140 --> 05:11:22.140
idea. One is we've changed the

05:11:22.650 --> 05:11:24.650
way we do our scheduling. So now

05:11:25.520 --> 05:11:27.520
we are now scheduling based on

05:11:27.588 --> 05:11:30.230
operator hiring or the pace of
operator hiring. If you MAY

05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:33.590
remember pre-covid, we were

05:11:34.629 --> 05:11:36.629
delivering in 92, 93% of our

05:11:37.132 --> 05:11:39.132
scheduled service. That means we

05:11:39.200 --> 05:11:41.200
were missing about 5 or 600

05:11:41.436 --> 05:11:43.436
trips a day, really, really

05:11:43.838 --> 05:11:45.838
impacting how customers viewed

05:11:46.375 --> 05:11:48.375
our service. You know, really

05:11:48.744 --> 05:11:50.744
breaking that kind of bond of

05:11:50.846 --> 05:11:52.380
trust that we were getting with
riders. So we have really

05:11:53.810 --> 05:11:55.810
refocused. We've pulled back. We

05:11:57.886 --> 05:12:00.654
now have about 82% or so of our
service, pre-covid schedule out

05:12:01.756 --> 05:12:04.492
on the streets. So we've really
reduced the amount of service

05:12:04.695 --> 05:12:06.695
we're putting out on the street,

05:12:07.663 --> 05:12:09.564
but we are now delivering 99 to
100% of service. So really

05:12:10.399 --> 05:12:12.500
trying to reacquaint that bond
with people that when we say

05:12:13.235 --> 05:12:15.360
there's going to be a bus there,
there's actually a bus there

05:12:16.704 --> 05:12:19.400
showing up on time. We are also,
of course, continuing our muni

05:12:19.808 --> 05:12:21.808
forward work. Michael just did a

05:12:23.212 --> 05:12:25.212
great job on the on the j church

05:12:25.348 --> 05:12:27.916
couple last month, this board
approved the geary project,

05:12:28.840 --> 05:12:30.840
which gave us the last ten

05:12:30.119 --> 05:12:32.253
blocks of transit lanes on
geary. So now the entire

05:12:33.880 --> 05:12:34.922
corridor has a has a transit
lane and protecting that

05:12:35.691 --> 05:12:38.326
service. We also this board also
recently approved the 29 sunset

05:12:38.962 --> 05:12:40.962
project, which we think will

05:12:41.564 --> 05:12:43.564
save about 15% travel time for

05:12:43.766 --> 05:12:45.766
that route over the next few

05:12:46.769 --> 05:12:48.303
months. Once we get the quick
build in place. So really

05:12:48.971 --> 05:12:51.105
exciting stuff getting getting
better use out of our existing

05:12:51.940 --> 05:12:54.909
resources. His and the last
project I wanted to highlight is

05:12:55.745 --> 05:12:58.480
our msw staff who you know I
think julie's talked about this

05:12:58.882 --> 05:13:01.517
before but the great work
they're doing on the it week to

05:13:02.118 --> 05:13:05.200
even come up with that idea and
then put it in place once a

05:13:05.521 --> 05:13:07.521
quarter in case you you don't

05:13:08.224 --> 05:13:11.126
know that project once a quarter
we shut down the subway a little

05:13:11.961 --> 05:13:13.961
bit early for a week we go in

05:13:14.197 --> 05:13:16.499
and do state of good repair work
so that it doesn't become an

05:13:16.967 --> 05:13:19.135
emergency and doesn't become
that huge long delay that the

05:13:20.136 --> 05:13:22.136
subway subway was seeing

05:13:22.505 --> 05:13:24.640
pre-covid. And that's why this
graph here is so important to

05:13:25.441 --> 05:13:28.177
us. We're really proud of it. We
reduced long subway delays by

05:13:29.579 --> 05:13:32.482
70. When you look at pre covid
service. And one of the big

05:13:32.816 --> 05:13:34.816
reasons for that really is that

05:13:35.319 --> 05:13:37.386
fixit week program. So the
customers are noticing, which I

05:13:37.988 --> 05:13:39.988
think is a super exciting part

05:13:40.457 --> 05:13:43.192
of this. You know, often we do
projects and it kind of goes

05:13:43.493 --> 05:13:45.493
unnoticed, but our approval

05:13:46.663 --> 05:13:48.663
rating is up 10% from 2021. We

05:13:49.233 --> 05:13:51.233
have of, you know, a lot of

05:13:51.368 --> 05:13:53.469
tweets and a lot of anecdotal
things that are saying that

05:13:53.604 --> 05:13:56.720
people are really appreciating
what we're doing. And I do want

05:13:56.306 --> 05:13:58.441
to point out that it's not just
the structural changes we're

05:13:59.420 --> 05:14:01.420
making on the muni forward side

05:14:01.178 --> 05:14:03.178
and the service side on, you

05:14:03.613 --> 05:14:05.481
know, on how we do our
maintenance work, our frontline

05:14:05.616 --> 05:14:08.585
staff are contributing a ton to
this, this idea of quality. Our

05:14:09.220 --> 05:14:11.220
maintenance staff, you know, our

05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:14.658
car cleaners, our operators are
really embracing this idea of,

05:14:17.610 --> 05:14:19.162
of, of leading with quality and
leading with kind of the

05:14:20.364 --> 05:14:22.732
customer and customer service as
our north star, as we keep

05:14:23.234 --> 05:14:25.234
delivering this service. So

05:14:25.236 --> 05:14:27.971
that's really exciting. And, you
know, our ridership is backing

05:14:30.141 --> 05:14:32.108
that up, backing up some of the
good things we're hearing. I

05:14:33.211 --> 05:14:35.445
want to I want to highlight I
can't say it enough and I'm

05:14:36.130 --> 05:14:38.147
really excited about it. I know
jeff and julie are two, but

05:14:39.116 --> 05:14:41.850
SEPTEMBER was our highest
ridership month in four years.

05:14:44.188 --> 05:14:46.188
You know, four years. It's super

05:14:46.791 --> 05:14:48.791
great going in the in a really

05:14:49.227 --> 05:14:51.428
great direction. If you look at
our average ridership in

05:14:52.497 --> 05:14:55.265
SEPTEMBER and average day versus
our average ridership in AUGUST

05:14:55.967 --> 05:14:57.967
on an average day we have about

05:14:57.970 --> 05:15:00.104
20,000 more people taking muni
in SEPTEMBER than they did in

05:15:00.973 --> 05:15:03.174
AUGUST. So going in the right
direction, really exciting to

05:15:05.877 --> 05:15:08.545
see. And if you if you look at
just those general trends, those

05:15:09.347 --> 05:15:11.482
are those are interesting. But
even more interesting is when we

05:15:12.500 --> 05:15:14.284
kind of dig down into it and
look at some specific lessons

05:15:14.921 --> 05:15:17.655
that we can learn from from
these trends. This this graph is

05:15:18.691 --> 05:15:20.691
showing what our top ten

05:15:22.261 --> 05:15:24.896
recovered lines are, meaning
looking at 2019, our pre-covid

05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:29.990
ridership and the 2023, what we

05:15:29.768 --> 05:15:32.169
saw in we were using actually
AUGUST for this this look, look

05:15:32.905 --> 05:15:34.905
ahead. So what we saw in AUGUST

05:15:35.740 --> 05:15:37.740
of 23 versus AUGUST of 19 and

05:15:37.143 --> 05:15:39.444
what lines, as you have seen,
the biggest growth and you'll

05:15:40.145 --> 05:15:42.145
see on there, you know, some

05:15:42.147 --> 05:15:44.147
lines are at 100, 120, 130% of

05:15:44.249 --> 05:15:46.249
what we were seeing in

05:15:46.452 --> 05:15:48.953
pre-covid. An interesting thing
to note is that seven out of ten

05:15:49.755 --> 05:15:51.757
of these lines are what we call
crosstown routes, meaning they

05:15:52.224 --> 05:15:55.930
are connecting neighborhood to
neighborhood. It's not the

05:15:55.795 --> 05:15:57.863
downtown centric you know,
straight into the financial

05:15:59.565 --> 05:16:02.434
district during the peak period
type of ridership. And that is

05:16:02.568 --> 05:16:04.568
just a really interesting

05:16:05.700 --> 05:16:07.700
testament to how the riders are

05:16:07.407 --> 05:16:09.407
using our system now, but also

05:16:09.776 --> 05:16:12.277
explains how you know, kind of
we need to shift our thinking

05:16:13.460 --> 05:16:15.914
and really kind of focus on
where ridership is going versus

05:16:16.983 --> 05:16:18.983
where we traditionally have have

05:16:19.385 --> 05:16:21.385
seen that ridership. Also, I do

05:16:21.454 --> 05:16:23.555
want to point out all ten of
these lines have either a

05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:28.930
capital project or or frequency

05:16:28.328 --> 05:16:30.529
changes attached to them as we
try to address this additional

05:16:32.665 --> 05:16:34.665
crowding that said, you know,

05:16:35.100 --> 05:16:37.100
our budget outlook is becoming a

05:16:37.203 --> 05:16:39.203
little bit more clear, and it

05:16:39.639 --> 05:16:42.240
does look most likely that
during the next two year period,

05:16:42.241 --> 05:16:44.241
we are not going to have an

05:16:45.846 --> 05:16:47.846
increase in in funds for adding

05:16:48.480 --> 05:16:50.480
service. And so what that means

05:16:50.818 --> 05:16:53.520
for us in my group is that we
are going to have to be making

05:16:54.120 --> 05:16:56.120
ng adjustments to crowding in

05:16:57.824 --> 05:16:59.824
and trip, trip, trip serving in

05:17:00.327 --> 05:17:02.327
a cost neutral manner. And that

05:17:03.464 --> 05:17:05.464
sounds kind of kind of strange,

05:17:05.599 --> 05:17:07.734
but basically what that means is
we're going to be moving

05:17:07.768 --> 05:17:10.360
resources around and on the
margins, really, it's there's no

05:17:11.605 --> 05:17:14.730
big huge moves that are going to
be made. It's trying to move.

05:17:14.141 --> 05:17:16.708
You know, we've got some
crowding over here. Let's take

05:17:17.345 --> 05:17:19.446
two busses from this line and
put it over there to try to

05:17:20.348 --> 05:17:23.160
reduce some of the crowding per
bus there. So it's going to be a

05:17:23.818 --> 05:17:26.219
lot of that kind of we're
calling cost neutral movement of

05:17:27.321 --> 05:17:29.490
resources is, of course, our,
you know, our our highest

05:17:30.124 --> 05:17:32.992
mandate is protecting the most
vulnerable of all of our users

05:17:33.961 --> 05:17:35.961
is so because of that, we really

05:17:36.264 --> 05:17:39.132
hope to really kind of continue
using the decision making

05:17:40.268 --> 05:17:42.970
framework. We protect we really
made during covid. And that's

05:17:44.672 --> 05:17:46.573
that's this slide here. I know
you guys have seen this several

05:17:47.541 --> 05:17:50.276
times, but, you know, focusing
on equity strategy,

05:17:51.479 --> 05:17:53.479
neighborhoods, using data, both

05:17:53.548 --> 05:17:56.383
actual ridership data, but also
feedback from from our customers

05:17:57.986 --> 05:17:59.986
on where service needs to go,

05:18:00.688 --> 05:18:02.856
where we need to add more
service on the on the margins

05:18:03.358 --> 05:18:05.358
and where we can take service

05:18:05.593 --> 05:18:08.428
from to make sure that that
happens in order to kind of

05:18:08.963 --> 05:18:11.766
formalize that framework. We're
starting a new program called

05:18:12.801 --> 05:18:15.536
the biannual service evaluation,
which will be looking at system

05:18:16.905 --> 05:18:19.873
needs a holistic look at system
needs across the entire system

05:18:21.242 --> 05:18:23.811
and then prioritize leading into
every two year budget cycle

05:18:25.130 --> 05:18:27.681
coming up. So this is not just a
data driven, data driven

05:18:27.817 --> 05:18:30.451
process. Of course, it will
involve a lot of stakeholder

05:18:31.530 --> 05:18:33.530
interactions and feedback. Most

05:18:34.690 --> 05:18:36.690
importantly, we are starting a

05:18:36.892 --> 05:18:39.393
muni equity working group that
will be directly involved in in

05:18:40.162 --> 05:18:42.730
talking through these trade offs
and how we make some of these

05:18:44.132 --> 05:18:47.200
decisions. So really excited to
get that work going and moving

05:18:48.704 --> 05:18:50.704
forward as we as we look once

05:18:51.540 --> 05:18:54.342
again at a cost neutral cost
neutral, forward looking stance.

05:18:57.546 --> 05:18:59.546
So that said, I wanted to you

05:18:59.781 --> 05:19:02.450
know, I think the theory behind
cost neutral is easy to

05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:05.190
understand. And, you know, maybe

05:19:06.656 --> 05:19:08.957
it it it kind of loses a little
bit in translation. So I wanted

05:19:10.826 --> 05:19:12.894
to walk through with real, real
examples like what does that

05:19:14.463 --> 05:19:16.631
mean on the street? How does how
does how do we make these

05:19:17.466 --> 05:19:19.466
changes? What are the impacts s

05:19:20.336 --> 05:19:22.336
and how do we reassess? So using

05:19:23.873 --> 05:19:25.873
what we did in AUGUST, AUGUST

05:19:25.942 --> 05:19:27.942
19th as the base of that

05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:30.110
beginning, beginning example, I

05:19:30.179 --> 05:19:33.810
want to talk through, you know,
it was the start of the school

05:19:33.916 --> 05:19:36.217
year. We looked at data at the
end of the previous school year,

05:19:37.154 --> 05:19:39.822
so the MAY JUNE data store where
crowding was happening in got

05:19:40.990 --> 05:19:42.958
cers from school students and
others to understand like kind

05:19:44.427 --> 05:19:46.729
of where the big problems were
going to be. When school started

05:19:47.497 --> 05:19:49.298
back up in AUGUST, one of our
biggest and most crowded lines

05:19:50.400 --> 05:19:52.400
was 19th avenue, specifically

05:19:53.136 --> 05:19:55.303
the 28. So we knew we had to get
some more service on 19th avenue

05:19:56.373 --> 05:19:58.373
when school started back up. But

05:19:58.375 --> 05:20:00.376
we also knew we had to do that
relatively in essentially cost

05:20:02.646 --> 05:20:05.314
neutral. So what we did was, is
we took the 28 local, reduced

05:20:07.830 --> 05:20:09.151
that frequency. So instead of
coming every nine minutes, it

05:20:10.653 --> 05:20:12.787
now comes every 12 minutes. And
with the busses we save from

05:20:13.290 --> 05:20:16.125
that, we started up the 28
rapid. And so now at our rapid

05:20:17.695 --> 05:20:20.960
stops on 19th avenue, we have
six minute service instead of

05:20:20.197 --> 05:20:22.197
nine minute service and we're

05:20:23.600 --> 05:20:25.735
able to do that really at a at a
cost neutral way. And you'll

05:20:25.902 --> 05:20:28.137
notice also in AUGUST we did
some extra school service, some

05:20:28.538 --> 05:20:30.538
extra school trippers, which we

05:20:31.776 --> 05:20:33.843
paid for by basically reducing
the five frequency on the

05:20:34.178 --> 05:20:36.178
weekends. So you know, that's

05:20:36.847 --> 05:20:39.148
how we that's how we kind of
made some adjustments cost

05:20:40.684 --> 05:20:43.190
neutrally, but, you know, since
then we've been doing a lot of

05:20:44.621 --> 05:20:46.823
data work and coming up with our
next round of service changes.

05:20:47.859 --> 05:20:49.859
And I want to bring up my acting

05:20:50.128 --> 05:20:52.162
manager of service planning,
jessica garcia, who's going to

05:20:52.764 --> 05:20:55.365
talk through the data that we
looked at and where we're going

05:21:03.107 --> 05:21:05.910
in AUGUST. So jessica. Thank
you. Good afternoon. Or good

05:21:07.545 --> 05:21:09.613
evening. Board of directors. As
sean mentioned, we wanted to

05:21:09.614 --> 05:21:12.315
share some of the ridership
trends that we've been seeing

05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:15.185
since making those changes in
AUGUST and also how they're

05:21:15.286 --> 05:21:17.286
influencing our service changes

05:21:17.422 --> 05:21:20.230
in the future here. So this
chart here compares current

05:21:20.658 --> 05:21:23.461
ridership on some of our highest
ridership routes to last fall,

05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:26.330
and we typically see an increase
in ridership when school starts.

05:21:27.399 --> 05:21:29.399
But we wanted to see how that

05:21:29.467 --> 05:21:31.468
compares to this time last year.
And so what we are seeing is

05:21:31.970 --> 05:21:34.710
even with that traditional spike
, that spike is actually even

05:21:35.240 --> 05:21:37.474
larger than it was last year on
these routes. And again,

05:21:37.675 --> 05:21:39.977
mentioning the 28, it was
particularly interesting in the

05:21:41.113 --> 05:21:43.314
data that we're seeing is even
with the introduction of the

05:21:44.716 --> 05:21:46.250
rapid line in AUGUST, instead of
the rapid line absorbing

05:21:48.553 --> 05:21:51.389
ridership from the 28 line, we
are seeing that the 28 line
ridership has been actually

05:21:52.570 --> 05:21:54.570
pretty stable and the 28 the

05:21:54.159 --> 05:21:56.927
rapid line is actually capturing
more riders. So overall, more

05:21:57.620 --> 05:21:59.831
people are riding the service
and it's just another indicator

05:22:00.733 --> 05:22:02.733
of our overall growth that we're

05:22:05.337 --> 05:22:07.337
seeing. And with that ridership

05:22:07.539 --> 05:22:10.441
increase, we also are seeing
increases in crowding. So this

05:22:11.443 --> 05:22:13.811
chart here shows the percent of
trips that are over crowding

05:22:15.214 --> 05:22:17.214
capacity in a given hour. And we

05:22:17.316 --> 05:22:20.252
have a defined threshold for how
many people can fit on a vehicle

05:22:20.486 --> 05:22:23.121
depending on its size. And in
this chart, we defined a crowded

05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:26.291
trip as a trip where the
passenger load meets that

05:22:27.926 --> 05:22:29.926
crowding threshold for at least

05:22:29.995 --> 05:22:32.163
5% of the trips along that route
. So looking at this data, it

05:22:32.766 --> 05:22:34.766
really helps us to see which

05:22:34.834 --> 05:22:37.350
routes need more capacity and at
what time of the day. And a

05:22:38.504 --> 05:22:41.173
trend that we have been seeing
is that the crowding is
happening at actually very

05:22:44.410 --> 05:22:46.410
concentrated periods of the day.

05:22:46.545 --> 05:22:49.447
So it's good news to see that
our ridership is increasing. But

05:22:49.515 --> 05:22:52.451
the challenge is with our
resource constraints is how are

05:22:52.819 --> 05:22:54.987
we going to address that? How
are we going to address that

05:22:56.489 --> 05:22:58.857
demand in a cost neutral way?
And so this slide narrows down,

05:22:59.692 --> 05:23:02.127
narrows down the previous chart
to concentrate on the routes

05:23:03.329 --> 05:23:05.329
where we are seeing needing the

05:23:05.565 --> 05:23:07.532
most help from here. We look at
the passenger loads at the stop

05:23:08.468 --> 05:23:11.337
level and the direction and the
time of day to know how much

05:23:11.371 --> 05:23:13.306
service we actually need to
reduce the crowding. So viewing

05:23:15.508 --> 05:23:17.743
the data in this way is really
helping us target out, be more

05:23:18.645 --> 05:23:21.413
targeted with our solutions. As,
for example, if the crowding on

05:23:22.480 --> 05:23:24.480
the 44 line is highest from 7 to

05:23:24.250 --> 05:23:26.953
8 A.M. In only one direction,
then we can then look for more

05:23:27.454 --> 05:23:30.890
efficient solutions to address
the crowding, such as maybe

05:23:30.157 --> 05:23:32.157
scheduling operators to do an

05:23:32.426 --> 05:23:35.294
extra trip on the 44 line before
do they go to their regular

05:23:35.595 --> 05:23:37.595
route instead of assigning an

05:23:37.597 --> 05:23:39.597
extra vehicle on that bus for

05:23:40.734 --> 05:23:42.868
the entire day? So we are also
looking at the inverse of this

05:23:44.405 --> 05:23:46.405
data to knew, to know where to

05:23:46.507 --> 05:23:48.674
pull from, um, so that we can
know how many resources we can

05:23:48.843 --> 05:23:50.843
pull without pulling too much.

05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:53.110
And so overall, this approach

05:23:53.280 --> 05:23:56.820
has been driving our decision
options to reallocate resources

05:23:56.183 --> 05:23:58.517
where they are needed most,
especially in this environment

05:23:59.319 --> 05:24:01.388
where we're seeing the ridership
growing. But we're needing to

05:24:01.989 --> 05:24:04.725
find a way to address it cost
neutrally. It's also dynamic. So

05:24:04.725 --> 05:24:07.694
we are evaluating the
effectiveness with each service

05:24:07.862 --> 05:24:09.862
change and our fine tuning as

05:24:12.320 --> 05:24:14.320
needed. And so there are next

05:24:14.340 --> 05:24:16.603
service changes planned for this
winter with an effective date of

05:24:17.539 --> 05:24:20.474
JANUARY 20th. Using the data
that I just covered in those
previous slides, we identified

05:24:21.876 --> 05:24:24.845
these routes as those needing
increased frequency to address

05:24:25.580 --> 05:24:28.348
crowding during the school day
as well as on weekends. And for

05:24:29.283 --> 05:24:31.283
these routes we are increasing

05:24:31.619 --> 05:24:33.787
frequency another minute or two
on these routes with some of

05:24:34.523 --> 05:24:36.724
them being all day changes or
just where the frequency is

05:24:37.626 --> 05:24:39.760
needed based off of some of the
analysis that we've done to

05:24:40.862 --> 05:24:42.963
remain cost neutral, though, we
are offsetting these increases

05:24:44.198 --> 05:24:46.400
with decreases on other routes.
So we selected the routes though

05:24:47.569 --> 05:24:49.303
based on the extra capacity we
saw in the ridership data and

05:24:50.438 --> 05:24:53.374
are implementing the changes
that would not impact our

05:24:53.842 --> 05:24:55.842
ability to deliver high quality

05:24:55.877 --> 05:24:57.877
service. So the five rapid and

05:24:57.879 --> 05:24:59.879
local and the nine local will

05:25:00.480 --> 05:25:02.850
open up from a ten minute to a
12 minute. This will make the

05:25:02.984 --> 05:25:05.319
combined frequency on these
corridors is six minutes from

05:25:07.288 --> 05:25:10.570
the current five minutes and the
33 ashbury we are opening it

05:25:11.827 --> 05:25:13.827
from a 15 to a 20. The 15 line.

05:25:14.396 --> 05:25:17.298
We are not taking any resources
away, but we heard feedback that

05:25:17.466 --> 05:25:19.934
the line was not meeting its
schedule. So we're keeping the

05:25:20.680 --> 05:25:22.680
number of resources the same and

05:25:22.771 --> 05:25:25.740
instead adjusting the headways
from 10 to 12 to make the

05:25:26.208 --> 05:25:29.144
service more reliable. We are
also making a couple stop
changes to this route in

05:25:30.479 --> 05:25:32.648
response to feedback that we
heard to add better connections

05:25:32.648 --> 05:25:34.648
around the caltrain and ball

05:25:34.784 --> 05:25:36.784
park area in the hunters point

05:25:39.388 --> 05:25:41.489
area of this route. So in the
coming coming up with our

05:25:41.790 --> 05:25:44.192
service changes, as as sean
mentioned earlier, we want to

05:25:44.259 --> 05:25:46.495
take the opportunity again to
point out that we that looking

05:25:48.197 --> 05:25:50.165
at ridership is only part of the
larger decision making

05:25:51.000 --> 05:25:53.101
framework. Our overall approach
continues to be rooted in our

05:25:53.769 --> 05:25:56.571
equity strategy. And to refresh
your memories on the background

05:25:56.672 --> 05:25:59.340
of the equity strategy, it is
based on the muni equity policy

05:26:01.760 --> 05:26:03.412
that was established in 2014 and
the strategy is updated every

05:26:04.614 --> 05:26:06.815
two years with our budget cycle.
And the overall purpose is to

05:26:07.450 --> 05:26:09.450
focus our investments in the

05:26:09.619 --> 05:26:12.187
system centered around people
who need and depend on transit

05:26:12.755 --> 05:26:14.790
the most. So as sean mentioned
earlier, we'll be rolling the

05:26:15.591 --> 05:26:17.959
equity strategy framework into
that biannual service evaluation

05:26:18.861 --> 05:26:21.564
project. And I'll hand it back
to him to cover what our next

05:26:22.232 --> 05:26:25.167
steps are for that and others in
the coming coming months. Thank

05:26:28.872 --> 05:26:30.872
you. Great. Thank you. Thank

05:26:31.240 --> 05:26:33.240
you, jessica. So as we look to

05:26:33.343 --> 05:26:35.343
the next budget cycle, we'll be

05:26:35.378 --> 05:26:38.214
starting the biannual service
evaluation, working with our

05:26:39.216 --> 05:26:41.216
muni equity, working group and

05:26:41.952 --> 05:26:44.287
then, of course, continuing to
make cost neutral changes like

05:26:45.880 --> 05:26:47.880
we like we just went over, I

05:26:49.920 --> 05:26:51.920
think, you know, one thing I

05:26:51.428 --> 05:26:53.862
want to point out and you know,
michael did a great job on the

05:26:54.798 --> 05:26:57.567
j. You know, there are a number
of lines that are not going to

05:26:58.635 --> 05:27:00.635
rise to the level of needing

05:27:00.671 --> 05:27:02.705
additional service. You know,
based on crowding, based on

05:27:03.340 --> 05:27:06.209
ridership. And the j is one of
those lines we are not planning

05:27:06.977 --> 05:27:08.977
to add service per se to that

05:27:08.979 --> 05:27:10.979
line right now, but we are still

05:27:11.480 --> 05:27:13.450
doing capital projects like the
muni forward program to still

05:27:13.786 --> 05:27:15.786
improve the quality of service

05:27:16.520 --> 05:27:18.520
on that line, regardless of, you

05:27:18.689 --> 05:27:21.524
know, actual service resources.
And we'll be able to, you know,

05:27:21.759 --> 05:27:24.227
if we can save enough time, we
can roll those resources back

05:27:26.263 --> 05:27:28.431
into the j itself. So just
wanted to point that out. And

05:27:29.368 --> 05:27:31.702
with that, glad to take any
questions or comments. Thank you

05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:34.470
so much. Director hemminger,

05:27:38.876 --> 05:27:41.477
please. So sean, when are you
going to start picking on the

05:27:43.280 --> 05:27:45.280
five? Fulton well, I mean, you

05:27:46.283 --> 05:27:48.452
hit you hit us in AUGUST and now
you're going to hit us again.

05:27:49.387 --> 05:27:52.289
What a memory you're going to
roll in the five r, which is the

05:27:53.324 --> 05:27:56.293
best thing muniz ever done. Well
yeah. You know, that was like my

05:27:56.360 --> 05:27:59.196
first project, by the way. I'm
really proud of that project. It

05:27:59.397 --> 05:28:02.198
used to be called the, you know,
the, the five limited, but we

05:28:02.633 --> 05:28:05.269
changed the name to rapid lo
those many years ago. But yeah,

05:28:07.139 --> 05:28:10.400
you know, unfortunately or maybe
fortunately, I don't know how

05:28:11.676 --> 05:28:14.445
you look at it but you know the
five corridor has more service

05:28:15.613 --> 05:28:17.748
on it than, than than what it
needs. Now I know that that I

05:28:18.783 --> 05:28:20.783
know that trip by trip or trip

05:28:20.918 --> 05:28:22.918
by trip, that's not necessarily

05:28:22.988 --> 05:28:25.690
true. But right. Well, and when
you're looking at the whole

05:28:25.824 --> 05:28:28.590
system, you know, and trying to
weigh all those different

05:28:29.528 --> 05:28:32.162
things, the five just has a lot
of service on there. What what

05:28:32.197 --> 05:28:34.197
we're proposing right now is

05:28:34.366 --> 05:28:37.000
it'll go to 12 and to 12. So the
long and the short will both be

05:28:38.202 --> 05:28:40.700
12. So that still gives us six
in the inner portion of the

05:28:41.207 --> 05:28:43.207
line. But you know, the point of

05:28:43.409 --> 05:28:45.477
kind of going over those AUGUST
changes and now these next

05:28:48.514 --> 05:28:50.315
JANUARY changes is to say. That,
you know, it's all iterative and

05:28:51.183 --> 05:28:53.183
iterative and we'll just we're

05:28:53.519 --> 05:28:55.553
going to keep looking at it. And
obviously, if we MISS The mark,

05:28:56.355 --> 05:28:59.224
you know, and we and we pulled
too far back in the five, we'll

05:28:59.459 --> 05:29:02.160
be finding a way to put some
more service back in there the

05:29:02.895 --> 05:29:05.830
next time. So when you say cost
neutral. Yeah. I mean, how fine

05:29:06.332 --> 05:29:08.567
grained do you get? Because I
assume some bus lines are more

05:29:08.567 --> 05:29:10.567
expensive to run because they

05:29:11.303 --> 05:29:13.938
attract more senior drivers. I
mean, am I wrong? Well, I mean,

05:29:14.874 --> 05:29:17.420
well. So cost neutral meaning
the umbrella of our overall

05:29:17.143 --> 05:29:19.143
operating budget will stay

05:29:19.879 --> 05:29:21.879
basically the same. And how you

05:29:22.515 --> 05:29:25.383
kind of plug and play in there.
You know, typically we use might

05:29:26.419 --> 05:29:28.419
have played into the effect on

05:29:29.755 --> 05:29:31.755
the five, right? No yeah. No.

05:29:31.925 --> 05:29:33.925
Right. Right. No no. We don't

05:29:35.929 --> 05:29:38.330
lay off our senior personnel and
then that's that's what I have

05:29:39.532 --> 05:29:42.367
to conclude. Yeah. Yeah. Well so
and that's why all these service

05:29:43.136 --> 05:29:45.203
changes are tied to sign ups.
Right. Because what happens is,

05:29:46.272 --> 05:29:48.272
if we, if we say we're taking a

05:29:48.408 --> 05:29:50.509
couple busses off the five and
senior operators wanted to drive

05:29:50.978 --> 05:29:52.978
those, now they can't right now

05:29:53.413 --> 05:29:55.413
their seniority allows them to

05:29:55.615 --> 05:29:57.615
pick other runs where it makes a

05:29:57.651 --> 05:30:00.520
lot of money so they can go to a
different line and make the same

05:30:00.220 --> 05:30:02.321
amount or more money depending
on their seniority. So I'm

05:30:03.156 --> 05:30:05.391
hoping that the five user to my
right will make some comments as

05:30:05.926 --> 05:30:07.926
well. I can only speak for

05:30:08.629 --> 05:30:10.629
myself. Yeah, tough decisions

05:30:10.964 --> 05:30:13.633
for sure. I see you, director
henderson. I have a related

05:30:14.768 --> 05:30:17.570
comment to that, if I if I MAY,
and this is just I remember when

05:30:18.338 --> 05:30:20.973
we did the very significant
redesign of the transit system

05:30:21.808 --> 05:30:23.808
during covid took away some

05:30:23.877 --> 05:30:26.746
lines. You made recommendations
to bring back certain lines.

05:30:28.282 --> 05:30:30.850
Some were left out, out. And
then sort of in response to

05:30:32.860 --> 05:30:34.860
public feedback as I recall, we

05:30:34.221 --> 05:30:36.221
sort of reluctantly brought back

05:30:37.424 --> 05:30:40.293
some lines that maybe had not
been in staff's initial
strategic recommendation. And I

05:30:41.295 --> 05:30:43.295
would think because it's been a

05:30:43.331 --> 05:30:46.990
topic of conversation today,
like the 21 is one that

05:30:46.667 --> 05:30:49.369
occurred, that it feels to me
like it's part of that category,

05:30:49.637 --> 05:30:51.705
like it was not originally your
recommendation to bring it back.

05:30:52.873 --> 05:30:55.675
And then we did in response to
public comment. So what I want

05:30:55.943 --> 05:30:58.144
to know is what have we learned
from that? Because the case was

05:30:59.381 --> 05:31:01.982
made effectively that it's a
lower frequency route, that the

05:31:02.117 --> 05:31:04.885
five is performing much higher
service and ridership anyway. So

05:31:07.550 --> 05:31:09.589
why bring that back? We did, as
supervisor preston said today,

05:31:09.724 --> 05:31:11.792
it's running at very low
frequencies. My anecdotal

05:31:11.793 --> 05:31:13.793
experience, it's not that

05:31:15.263 --> 05:31:17.498
reliable all it's very empty. So
I want to know what we have

05:31:18.330 --> 05:31:20.435
learned from those ones where we
maybe made the decision that we

05:31:20.435 --> 05:31:22.435
had not originally recommended

05:31:23.605 --> 05:31:25.605
as a nod to what we heard from

05:31:25.674 --> 05:31:27.741
the community. And if in fact we
are affirmed in our initial

05:31:29.410 --> 05:31:31.410
recommendation. And then why

05:31:31.479 --> 05:31:34.214
aren't we seeing some of those
proposed for reduced service if

05:31:35.718 --> 05:31:37.652
that was staff's original
recommendation, does that make

05:31:38.220 --> 05:31:39.954
sense? I know there's a little
bit convoluted. Sean, do you

05:31:42.123 --> 05:31:44.123
want to take that or do you want

05:31:44.526 --> 05:31:46.727
me to? Sure. Well, I mean, I can
start and then and then maybe

05:31:47.529 --> 05:31:49.529
you can add add any extra bit in

05:31:49.664 --> 05:31:52.101
there. But you know, yeah. You
know, we have definitely learned
a, you know, we're always

05:31:52.101 --> 05:31:54.101
learning. Hopefully knock on

05:31:54.770 --> 05:31:56.770
wood and you know, the 21

05:31:56.906 --> 05:31:59.674
provides us some connectivity
for some people that maybe had

05:32:00.809 --> 05:32:03.411
mobility issues or something
getting up to the five or down

05:32:03.946 --> 05:32:05.946
to the seven. But yeah, you

05:32:06.148 --> 05:32:08.649
know, we have seen stronger
ridership on the five and the

05:32:09.519 --> 05:32:11.653
seven than than the 21 is
providing. And you know, we're

05:32:12.488 --> 05:32:14.589
just going to have to continue
to make those those changes. At

05:32:15.924 --> 05:32:18.590
this point, we are not proposing
. I think what you're trying to

05:32:18.994 --> 05:32:21.896
get at is, well, why don't we
just, you know, not run the 21

05:32:22.865 --> 05:32:25.433
and instead that way we wouldn't
have to reduce service on the

05:32:25.600 --> 05:32:28.237
five. You know, at this point,
like I said, we're pretty these

05:32:28.604 --> 05:32:30.604
are pretty like minor changes.

05:32:31.607 --> 05:32:33.609
And our budget, you know, it it
it looks pretty stable, at

05:32:33.609 --> 05:32:36.211
least, you know, for right now
it could all change of course.

05:32:36.746 --> 05:32:39.247
but I don't think we have to
make those kind of big, drastic

05:32:39.882 --> 05:32:42.384
moves at this point. We're
making some subtle changes based

05:32:43.319 --> 05:32:45.319
on crowding. But you know for

05:32:45.355 --> 05:32:47.556
sure, if the budget system or
the budget outlook goes goes,

05:32:48.391 --> 05:32:50.391
goes south, then, you know,

05:32:50.960 --> 05:32:53.128
things are back on the table and
we're going to have to get more

05:32:54.497 --> 05:32:57.365
drastic because, like I said,
we're we're doing cost neutral
cuts. If we have to actually

05:32:58.601 --> 05:33:00.435
save money, it's a different
ball game and we're going to

05:33:00.937 --> 05:33:02.937
have to be coming back to you

05:33:02.973 --> 05:33:05.808
with with much harder decisions.
Thank you. And if I could add a

05:33:05.976 --> 05:33:07.976
couple points to that as well.

05:33:08.440 --> 05:33:10.790
So san francisco, though, is one
of the cities in the world with

05:33:11.715 --> 05:33:14.216
the greatest extent of work from
home. That wiped out the

05:33:15.118 --> 05:33:17.118
financial base, not only for

05:33:17.987 --> 05:33:20.923
muni, but particularly for bart.
That was really, really
dependent upon downtown

05:33:23.126 --> 05:33:25.695
commuters. Those folks are
slowly trickling in to downtown

05:33:26.597 --> 05:33:28.597
san francisco and activity and

05:33:29.599 --> 05:33:31.834
ridership is slowly coming back.
So one of the things that we

05:33:32.202 --> 05:33:34.202
learned is adapting to changing

05:33:34.237 --> 05:33:36.237
travel patterns is super

05:33:36.407 --> 05:33:38.407
important. And no property in

05:33:38.576 --> 05:33:40.576
the united states has adapted

05:33:41.645 --> 05:33:44.480
more to changing travel patterns
than the team at muni. The

05:33:44.648 --> 05:33:46.648
second thing that we learned is

05:33:47.217 --> 05:33:49.217
that investing in making transit

05:33:49.520 --> 05:33:51.520
, as sean said, fast, frequent,

05:33:51.721 --> 05:33:53.721
reliable, clean, safe that drove

05:33:54.826 --> 05:33:57.627
ridership up far more than
anything that we dreamt

05:33:58.396 --> 05:34:00.396
possible. So here we're in the

05:34:00.631 --> 05:34:02.966
city in the united states with
some of the greatest loss of

05:34:04.402 --> 05:34:06.402
transit riders due the loss of

05:34:06.937 --> 05:34:09.506
commuters. We also have some of
the transit lines with the

05:34:09.540 --> 05:34:11.540
greatest rate of pre-covid

05:34:12.110 --> 05:34:14.110
ridership recovery in the entire

05:34:14.412 --> 05:34:16.412
country. What are we at? It's

05:34:17.415 --> 05:34:19.415
over 130% on the 49 and close to

05:34:19.717 --> 05:34:21.717
that on the 22 fillmore that we

05:34:21.719 --> 05:34:23.719
had never dreamt like we were

05:34:23.988 --> 05:34:25.988
hoping to get up to pre-covid,

05:34:26.891 --> 05:34:28.891
we never dreamt that it was

05:34:29.361 --> 05:34:31.361
possible to greatly exceed

05:34:31.596 --> 05:34:33.596
pre-covid ridership on now ten

05:34:35.700 --> 05:34:38.602
of our lines so that was an
extraordinary learning that

05:34:39.971 --> 05:34:41.971
people would respond to so

05:34:42.400 --> 05:34:44.541
quickly, even when overall
travel is down. If we deliver

05:34:45.610 --> 05:34:47.610
quality of service and at the

05:34:47.746 --> 05:34:49.746
same time, the third thing that

05:34:50.816 --> 05:34:53.784
we learned a lot of it in the
very, very detailed work that we

05:34:54.720 --> 05:34:56.720
did with community in the

05:34:57.122 --> 05:34:59.122
tenderloin in japantown town and

05:34:59.257 --> 05:35:01.257
other neighborhoods, is that for

05:35:01.293 --> 05:35:04.194
some of our lower ridership and
lower frequency lines, some or

05:35:04.997 --> 05:35:06.997
portions of those lines were

05:35:07.433 --> 05:35:09.433
exceeding important to community

05:35:12.438 --> 05:35:14.539
members and that align in 2 or 3
blocks away simply didn't

05:35:15.707 --> 05:35:18.175
replace that function. So one of
the reasons why I think the two

05:35:20.445 --> 05:35:22.647
sutter is a really interesting
case study where we brought the

05:35:22.882 --> 05:35:24.882
line back but reconfigured it

05:35:25.384 --> 05:35:28.153
and shortened it based upon what
we heard. And the two is

05:35:29.655 --> 05:35:32.390
actually getting more riders
than I would have expected,

05:35:33.225 --> 05:35:35.726
given that it is significantly
shorter. Similarly, the 27

05:35:36.862 --> 05:35:38.963
bryant we rearranged in
interesting ways and have been

05:35:39.799 --> 05:35:41.799
tracking that significantly.

05:35:42.936 --> 05:35:44.936
It's never going to be crush

05:35:46.706 --> 05:35:48.706
loaded like the 49 vns but but

05:35:49.208 --> 05:35:52.100
it remains exceedingly important
for the riders that it serves.

05:35:53.512 --> 05:35:55.781
And so that is our challenge.
And one of the reasons why we're

05:35:55.781 --> 05:35:57.781
fighting so hard for additional

05:35:58.785 --> 05:36:00.785
resources. Muni is this outlier

05:36:01.254 --> 05:36:03.389
buyer success story in terms of
how we've made investments

05:36:03.623 --> 05:36:05.623
during covid, but our underlying

05:36:06.292 --> 05:36:08.894
financial goals are still weak
because we can't reroute our

05:36:10.897 --> 05:36:13.732
train lines. Our train lines are
all pointed downtown. I can't

05:36:13.734 --> 05:36:15.801
have them serve our
neighborhoods. And so we're

05:36:16.903 --> 05:36:19.538
still struggling with our
financial base and seeking

05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:25.978
additional gap funding as for
our ridership starts to increase

05:36:26.460 --> 05:36:28.460
throughout the system and not

05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:30.470
just on our our non downtown

05:36:30.750 --> 05:36:32.750
lines. So core core learnings.

05:36:34.755 --> 05:36:37.490
Director henderson, please. Yes,
I just have a couple of I think

05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:40.159
I'm going to say some of my
questions to the future

05:36:40.560 --> 05:36:42.560
presentation that you mentioned,

05:36:42.796 --> 05:36:44.796
but I just have a quick question

05:36:45.999 --> 05:36:47.999
about how will you measure the

05:36:48.680 --> 05:36:50.680
crowding? So is it measured just

05:36:51.339 --> 05:36:53.406
by taps or are you doing some
sort of visual survey or like

05:36:54.675 --> 05:36:56.442
how does the. Yeah, great. No,
good question. Yeah our busses

05:36:57.511 --> 05:37:00.179
and now trains are equipped with
with are equipped with what's

05:37:01.215 --> 05:37:04.500
called apcs or automatic
passenger counters. So every

05:37:05.786 --> 05:37:07.888
time somebody gets on or off a
bus, we know somebody's getting

05:37:09.724 --> 05:37:11.524
on or off. We don't go by fare
revenue. We don't go. We by

05:37:12.660 --> 05:37:15.595
visual inspection except on the
on the cable car system. So so,

05:37:17.431 --> 05:37:19.431
so yeah, all of our busses now

05:37:19.633 --> 05:37:21.633
have apcs and same with our rail

05:37:22.336 --> 05:37:24.336
system. Got it. And then excuse

05:37:26.740 --> 05:37:28.740
me. I'm sorry. Also the slide

05:37:28.409 --> 05:37:30.409
that you had about with the

05:37:34.480 --> 05:37:36.480
tweets or the x's. It just says

05:37:36.384 --> 05:37:38.151
to me that there are some
thought about customer

05:37:39.320 --> 05:37:42.210
satisfaction. And so I'm curious
to know not now, but I'm just

05:37:43.925 --> 05:37:46.126
curious to know how are the ways
that you go about determining

05:37:46.695 --> 05:37:48.695
customer satisfaction from, you

05:37:48.797 --> 05:37:50.797
know, I'm sure through social

05:37:51.766 --> 05:37:54.701
and other or other ways, you
know, there's you know, when

05:37:55.303 --> 05:37:57.804
you're in the airport, right,
and they have the happy face or

05:37:58.139 --> 05:38:00.139
the smile, the sad face in the

05:38:00.576 --> 05:38:02.310
bathroom, you know, is there
like some version of that for.

05:38:02.944 --> 05:38:04.944
Well, we do. Do we do a rider

05:38:05.647 --> 05:38:08.480
survey? And that was the number
I was quoting. I quoted that we

05:38:08.650 --> 05:38:11.518
were up 10% on favorability
since 2021. So we do do a rider

05:38:11.986 --> 05:38:13.986
survey to gauge customer

05:38:14.222 --> 05:38:16.222
satisfaction and what they feel.

05:38:18.227 --> 05:38:20.428
Additionally, the city does also
. So same kind of thing. They

05:38:20.729 --> 05:38:23.331
don't obviously don't do riders,
they do the general population.

05:38:23.331 --> 05:38:25.331
But yeah, there's several

05:38:26.668 --> 05:38:28.668
different methods that we gather

05:38:28.804 --> 05:38:31.639
that information. The tweets I
note we carry a relatively

05:38:32.974 --> 05:38:34.974
robust social media presence.

05:38:36.445 --> 05:38:39.147
And so we have pios that monitor
tweets, get back to people that

05:38:39.215 --> 05:38:41.215
are tweeting, and then we

05:38:41.617 --> 05:38:43.518
capture some of the some of the
good ones. So we also have

05:38:44.520 --> 05:38:47.488
what's called 301. So really,
it's a it's an information

05:38:48.123 --> 05:38:50.157
system. I mean, usually it's
used for complaints, but

05:38:50.892 --> 05:38:52.892
sometimes people say good stuff,

05:38:52.962 --> 05:38:54.929
too. So you know, we have a
number of different ways that we

05:38:55.631 --> 05:38:58.266
capture what people generally
think. Okay. Thank you,

05:39:04.473 --> 05:39:06.473
director. So. So I really

05:39:06.742 --> 05:39:09.712
appreciate that to share all
these data. And it's like a

05:39:10.747 --> 05:39:12.747
really nice way. One thing about

05:39:14.317 --> 05:39:17.119
is like transparency is very key
to bestow trust amount all the

05:39:18.287 --> 05:39:20.287
stakeholders and I really

05:39:21.724 --> 05:39:23.892
appreciate to show us like how
you dissect the data to really

05:39:24.227 --> 05:39:26.227
identify why the overcrowding

05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:29.432
and the busses that where we
need the resources. So really

05:39:30.400 --> 05:39:32.400
applaud you on that especially

05:39:34.537 --> 05:39:36.537
me addressing crowding for our

05:39:37.340 --> 05:39:39.340
school kids time like the number

05:39:40.510 --> 05:39:42.510
49, the number 29 and the 44

05:39:42.812 --> 05:39:44.812
which each service not only high

05:39:45.480 --> 05:39:47.917
school children but also
elementary school children. And

05:39:48.852 --> 05:39:50.852
I really appreciate these effort

05:39:51.655 --> 05:39:53.655
and the presentation on the

05:39:54.900 --> 05:39:57.260
numbers on the charts is really
self explanatory. I love it. I

05:39:59.896 --> 05:40:01.896
only wish that we can see when

05:40:02.332 --> 05:40:05.340
the really friendly, smart lady
who show us the jessica. Yeah,

05:40:05.103 --> 05:40:07.103
right. Thank you. Thank you,

05:40:07.571 --> 05:40:10.506
jessica. When she said that she
used the same strategy to look
at the inverse version to

05:40:13.760 --> 05:40:15.760
identify by which bus line that

05:40:16.113 --> 05:40:18.113
we can utilize, because that MAY

05:40:19.650 --> 05:40:21.650
be a little bit overly resourced

05:40:22.860 --> 05:40:24.860
. So we can create a equilibrium

05:40:24.188 --> 05:40:26.188
equilibrium and cost neutral

05:40:26.423 --> 05:40:28.423
hopefully. Right. Kind of like

05:40:28.859 --> 05:40:31.527
take some of the area. I wish I
can see those numbers to

05:40:33.864 --> 05:40:36.320
identify that. Like how the san
bruno number nine and then the

05:40:38.736 --> 05:40:40.736
bayview 15 is actually ended up

05:40:42.273 --> 05:40:44.273
on the board of like increasing

05:40:45.309 --> 05:40:47.309
wait time. So I would like to

05:40:48.679 --> 05:40:51.481
see those similar transparency
on data. Mostly it will be

05:40:52.783 --> 05:40:54.783
helping us and also helping our

05:40:54.986 --> 05:40:57.955
communities to understand. And
wait a second, you know, because

05:40:58.623 --> 05:41:01.458
we are talking about we are
looking at racial equity and

05:41:03.940 --> 05:41:05.228
communities and but then now
we're like looking at the san

05:41:06.530 --> 05:41:08.431
bruno and I and number nine and
also the bayview number 15,

05:41:09.500 --> 05:41:11.500
where we haven't actually

05:41:12.337 --> 05:41:14.337
increased the speed for the t

05:41:15.607 --> 05:41:17.607
line. So actually after getting

05:41:19.177 --> 05:41:21.979
off of not DR. Sorry director
henderson swearing in ceremony I

05:41:24.315 --> 05:41:26.416
jump onto the t, but then the t
got stopped for no other,

05:41:27.585 --> 05:41:29.585
whatever reason. So then I was

05:41:29.788 --> 05:41:31.788
told by the operator to quickly

05:41:32.458 --> 05:41:34.458
hop on the number 15 and that

05:41:37.620 --> 05:41:39.764
that 15 is fun because it just
goes it zipped literally. Thank

05:41:42.601 --> 05:41:45.535
you. It zips through so, so, so
I would love to see those

05:41:47.172 --> 05:41:49.172
similar level of presentation.

05:41:49.174 --> 05:41:52.430
So it just helps us and also
help the public to understand.

05:41:53.212 --> 05:41:55.212
And maybe there's too many zips,

05:41:55.280 --> 05:41:57.280
you know, I don't know. So and

05:41:58.917 --> 05:42:01.886
also maybe if because the number
nine express had already taken

05:42:03.121 --> 05:42:05.121
care of the majority of the

05:42:05.591 --> 05:42:08.920
capacity of the passenger for,
then we can actually delegate

05:42:08.795 --> 05:42:10.795
the number nine. But we should

05:42:10.863 --> 05:42:12.863
it will help us to deliver that

05:42:12.965 --> 05:42:14.965
story to the public better in a

05:42:16.836 --> 05:42:18.836
comprehensive way. So then that

05:42:19.571 --> 05:42:21.571
then we can really get out here

05:42:22.475 --> 05:42:24.910
really happily. So that's that's
all I wanted to say. But I'm I'm

05:42:26.446 --> 05:42:28.446
happy that we're adding more on

05:42:28.581 --> 05:42:30.581
number 22 on the weekend. That's

05:42:31.551 --> 05:42:34.319
my favorite line. And the
warriors season's coming and

05:42:35.521 --> 05:42:37.521
also all the concerts. So I'm

05:42:38.900 --> 05:42:40.900
looking forward to that. So

05:42:40.393 --> 05:42:43.195
thank you. And number 44 is my
daughter's favorite line. So

05:42:45.980 --> 05:42:47.980
that's I got to tell her, hey,

05:42:47.400 --> 05:42:49.400
you don't have to wait for too

05:42:49.702 --> 05:42:51.702
long now. So thank you,

05:42:51.738 --> 05:42:54.573
director. So I want to use this
as an opportunity to do a

05:42:54.741 --> 05:42:56.741
shameless plug of our data

05:42:57.678 --> 05:42:59.678
portal. So all of the data that

05:42:59.947 --> 05:43:01.947
sean showed today is available

05:43:03.583 --> 05:43:05.718
on our muni data portal and is
updated every month. And that's

05:43:08.254 --> 05:43:10.756
at. Sfmta.Com/muni data. It
shows the crowding, the

05:43:11.991 --> 05:43:13.991
ridership recovery, total system

05:43:14.161 --> 05:43:16.362
ridership. We try to be
completely transparent with the

05:43:17.831 --> 05:43:19.832
public about how we make hard
choices with our limited

05:43:22.769 --> 05:43:24.769
resources. Thank you. Thank you,

05:43:25.720 --> 05:43:27.373
director. So and I just do want
to underscore, I'm a little bit

05:43:28.675 --> 05:43:30.910
dismayed to see the 15
bayview-hunters point express on

05:43:31.120 --> 05:43:33.120
that line for decreased

05:43:33.247 --> 05:43:35.148
frequency as well. I consider
that a huge success story. We've

05:43:36.317 --> 05:43:39.180
celebrated that line again and
again. That was a close
partnership with shamann

05:43:39.587 --> 05:43:42.288
walton's office. I understand we
have to make tough choices. The

05:43:42.456 --> 05:43:45.580
nature of my previous question
was if there were certain lines

05:43:45.580 --> 05:43:47.580
that were marginal to bring back

05:43:48.228 --> 05:43:51.970
at all before or and you had you
had tried to convince us that we

05:43:51.298 --> 05:43:54.134
don't even need to bring back
those lines. I would rather see

05:43:54.402 --> 05:43:57.270
some of those lines on this list
than what I consider to be some

05:43:57.471 --> 05:44:00.206
of our workhorse routes, like
the five, five, 15 and the nine.

05:44:00.274 --> 05:44:03.420
That's the nature of my
question. Yeah. So so that's

05:44:03.511 --> 05:44:05.511
great. So just trying to explain

05:44:07.282 --> 05:44:10.160
this a little bit more, the you
know, I was I was when we were

05:44:11.586 --> 05:44:13.420
talking about the five, I said,
you know, it's good or bad,

05:44:14.289 --> 05:44:16.590
depending on your point of view
because there's so much service

05:44:17.258 --> 05:44:19.593
on the lines like the five line,
the 38, the nine, the 14 that

05:44:21.229 --> 05:44:23.229
when we're looking for a few

05:44:23.932 --> 05:44:26.801
busses, you know, you go to
those lines and not the lines

05:44:27.690 --> 05:44:29.690
where a bus is coming every half

05:44:29.504 --> 05:44:31.839
hour. Because if you take a bus
that comes every half hour now

05:44:31.840 --> 05:44:34.775
you're talking about our
headways and that's, you know,

05:44:35.243 --> 05:44:37.243
no basically no service. So, you

05:44:37.345 --> 05:44:39.947
know, it really becomes that's
where the balancing act comes

05:44:41.483 --> 05:44:43.585
in. And I would just say on the
15, just to reiterate what

05:44:44.386 --> 05:44:46.386
jessica said, we are we're not

05:44:47.220 --> 05:44:49.220
taking any actual busses off the

05:44:49.124 --> 05:44:51.124
15. We're having problems

05:44:51.159 --> 05:44:54.940
meeting the schedule with the 15
because the running time is not

05:44:55.997 --> 05:44:58.980
correct. We had too few busses
to meet the running time. And so

05:45:00.503 --> 05:45:02.670
the number of busses on the 15
is staying the exact same. But

05:45:02.871 --> 05:45:05.374
we're we're changing the
frequency so that it can

05:45:05.374 --> 05:45:08.760
actually come every 12 minutes
when we say we're going to be

05:45:08.210 --> 05:45:10.210
there instead of coming. You

05:45:11.980 --> 05:45:13.980
know, every 11 to 14 minutes. So

05:45:14.549 --> 05:45:17.285
hopefully by providing a more
like reliable system, it'll
actually work better. Even

05:45:18.187 --> 05:45:20.187
though on paper it looks like

05:45:20.589 --> 05:45:22.524
we're reducing the frequency by
two minutes, hopefully that made

05:45:23.626 --> 05:45:25.626
some kind of sense. But okay.

05:45:25.828 --> 05:45:27.828
Okay. Yeah. Please julie

05:45:28.897 --> 05:45:30.897
kirschbaum the only other thing

05:45:31.667 --> 05:45:33.667
I would add is that time frame

05:45:35.471 --> 05:45:37.471
for the changes that sean and

05:45:37.674 --> 05:45:39.674
jessica are making is very

05:45:39.909 --> 05:45:41.909
short, so we wouldn't without a

05:45:42.245 --> 05:45:44.245
more extensive public process.

05:45:45.181 --> 05:45:47.181
Reckon mend diverting the 21

05:45:47.183 --> 05:45:49.183
hayes resources is eliminating

05:45:50.319 --> 05:45:52.319
that route and then applying it

05:45:53.220 --> 05:45:55.220
to school crowding in the kind

05:45:55.658 --> 05:45:57.793
of 4 to 8 week period that
they've had to put together

05:45:57.961 --> 05:46:00.729
these types of changes. We're
doing things that are more

05:46:01.631 --> 05:46:03.631
incremental and less likely to

05:46:04.334 --> 05:46:06.334
be noticed by customers. But if

05:46:06.869 --> 05:46:09.572
it is the board's direct action
that we go back and look at some

05:46:10.774 --> 05:46:13.509
of those harder choices that
would take more of a process,

05:46:14.544 --> 05:46:16.544
yes, we can start to see how

05:46:16.680 --> 05:46:19.614
that would fit into the overall
work plan. It's just not

05:46:22.352 --> 05:46:24.352
something that would build trust

05:46:26.557 --> 05:46:28.557
under the timeframe that we're

05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:31.861
having to say, wow, AUGUST was
amazing. We thought we had

05:46:33.960 --> 05:46:35.960
solved school crowding and in

05:46:35.832 --> 05:46:37.767
fact we had put an itty bitty
band-aid on school crowding and

05:46:38.435 --> 05:46:40.435
now need to go back in JANUARY

05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:42.470
and make more robust changes. So

05:46:42.706 --> 05:46:45.375
having the board feedback back
on those kind of tough trade

05:46:46.176 --> 05:46:48.978
offs would would be very
helpful. And then we can take

05:46:50.470 --> 05:46:52.470
that back and think through the

05:46:52.316 --> 05:46:54.817
kind of timeline and the process
that would need to be allocated

05:46:56.453 --> 05:46:59.422
in order to consider those
bigger type changes. DR.

05:47:02.259 --> 05:47:04.259
Hemminger yeah, I won't be long

05:47:04.595 --> 05:47:06.696
here, but sean, I think you
mentioned the fact that if we're

05:47:07.865 --> 05:47:10.367
talking about saving money,
that's a totally different

05:47:11.302 --> 05:47:13.369
ballgame. And I guess I'm
wondering when that game is

05:47:15.606 --> 05:47:17.606
going to start and how prepared

05:47:18.142 --> 05:47:21.110
you are for it, because it does
it seems to me that's where we

05:47:22.747 --> 05:47:24.381
ought to focus a lot of our
attention. I mean, I was giving

05:47:24.982 --> 05:47:27.584
you a hard time about the five,
but this the changes you're

05:47:27.852 --> 05:47:29.852
making now are at the margins.

05:47:30.221 --> 05:47:32.221
Yep, exactly. Yep. If you need

05:47:34.312 --> 05:47:35.542
to save 20, that's not the
margins anymore. Nope. So do we

05:47:36.495 --> 05:47:38.495
have a schedule for when that

05:47:40.574 --> 05:47:43.300
whole bunch of trouble is going
to start? Yeah. So we've been

05:47:43.401 --> 05:47:45.135
more successful than we were
expecting at improving

05:47:46.604 --> 05:47:48.604
efficiency and generating

05:47:49.730 --> 05:47:51.730
revenue. So that pushed the

05:47:51.109 --> 05:47:52.642
soonest we would need to start
shrinking the agency into

05:47:54.913 --> 05:47:56.913
calendar year 25 when exactly in

05:47:57.683 --> 05:48:00.651
calendar year 25 is dependent.
You know, there's many the cliff

05:48:01.853 --> 05:48:04.221
is the cliff. The cliff just got
pushed out a little bit. We are

05:48:05.623 --> 05:48:08.458
of course, working very hard at
the metropolitan transportation

05:48:08.526 --> 05:48:10.761
commission level and at the
state legislature to identify

05:48:13.465 --> 05:48:15.933
additional gap funding to, you
know, the goal being to push the

05:48:18.137 --> 05:48:20.137
cliff out beyond the NOVEMBER 26

05:48:20.439 --> 05:48:22.439
election. And so in the

05:48:22.741 --> 05:48:25.676
meantime, we are keeping a very,
very close eye on revenue and on

05:48:27.546 --> 05:48:29.546
hiring, on thinking of hiring

05:48:30.349 --> 05:48:33.251
again as a throttle. So we can
we can push the throttle forward

05:48:35.154 --> 05:48:37.522
. And if revenue looks good and
we can hold the throttle steady,

05:48:38.590 --> 05:48:40.925
which is what we're doing right
now. So we're neither shrinking

05:48:40.926 --> 05:48:43.494
nor growing. We're continuing to
hire to replace those people

05:48:44.563 --> 05:48:46.563
lost through attrition. And then

05:48:46.966 --> 05:48:48.966
we can stop hiring in order to

05:48:49.135 --> 05:48:51.135
shrink the agency. And my goal

05:48:51.370 --> 05:48:54.172
from the very beginning of covid
was always making sure we have

05:48:56.341 --> 05:48:58.843
enough runway to be able to
shrink the agency as needed

05:48:59.478 --> 05:49:01.478
through attrition rather than

05:49:03.451 --> 05:49:05.451
layoffs in order to meet a worst

05:49:07.532 --> 05:49:10.389
case scenario, budget projection
. And we are maintaining that a

05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:14.359
lot of time I'm going to open to
public comment for anyone in the

05:49:15.861 --> 05:49:17.861
room on the transit item. Thank

05:49:23.870 --> 05:49:25.870
you for this update. Hey, good

05:49:27.540 --> 05:49:29.540
evening. I'll make this quick.

05:49:29.609 --> 05:49:32.544
I'm organizer in tenderloin. I
do appreciate this presentation

05:49:33.713 --> 05:49:35.847
on kind of curious about the
metro lines and how they're

05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:38.884
doing. I also appreciate the
comment about incremental

05:49:39.887 --> 05:49:41.887
changes versus anything drastic.

05:49:43.490 --> 05:49:46.580
I'm definitely think we should
not think about redirecting

05:49:47.327 --> 05:49:49.461
resources by getting rid of
services, at least not in the

05:49:50.430 --> 05:49:52.932
meantime. Um, I think we should
consider the timing of those

05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:55.300
decisions, especially if there
are any ballot measures that

05:49:57.370 --> 05:49:59.370
we're going to be pushing for in

05:49:59.173 --> 05:50:01.173
2024 for that, if we cut service

05:50:01.475 --> 05:50:03.710
, that could affect how people
will vote for a transit line

05:50:05.112 --> 05:50:07.112
that doesn't exist. So again,

05:50:07.514 --> 05:50:09.514
just want to make sure those are

05:50:09.582 --> 05:50:11.450
considered. I think I heard
director tomlin mentioning 2025.

05:50:12.850 --> 05:50:14.850
So I think that that's a good

05:50:14.455 --> 05:50:16.455
timing. But but definitely not

05:50:17.658 --> 05:50:19.793
into cutting the 21 or any of
the services that are currently

05:50:20.561 --> 05:50:23.129
running. So thank you for your
time. Okay. Thank you for
staying so late to provide

05:50:26.834 --> 05:50:29.669
comment. Our next speaker. Hi
stacy randecker this is it was

05:50:30.438 --> 05:50:32.438
great to hear this report and I

05:50:32.774 --> 05:50:34.875
love the little incremental cost
cutting. It seems like that's

05:50:35.810 --> 05:50:38.378
something that we should have
always been doing all along and

05:50:38.913 --> 05:50:41.147
maybe we have been, but like
that's that's the kind of stuff

05:50:42.617 --> 05:50:44.517
it should be. A well oiled
machine that is always being

05:50:45.119 --> 05:50:47.187
fine tuned based on needs. My
daughter started at balboa, but

05:50:47.555 --> 05:50:50.900
she graduated from lincoln and
she's one of those kids who got

05:50:51.920 --> 05:50:53.920
passed up many times last year

05:50:53.261 --> 05:50:55.996
and her trick was and many of
them, they would ride it

05:50:56.598 --> 05:50:58.598
backwards to ride it forward so

05:50:58.733 --> 05:51:01.601
that they actually could get on
the bus and so anything that can

05:51:02.370 --> 05:51:04.237
be done in terms of working with
the schools and their release

05:51:04.972 --> 05:51:07.141
times and the schedules and
whatever to make sure that our

05:51:08.744 --> 05:51:10.944
kids get where they're going.
Would be great. I mean, my son

05:51:11.779 --> 05:51:13.914
just got home hour and 11
minutes from lowell soccer. So

05:51:16.952 --> 05:51:18.952
it's really tough to be sticking

05:51:20.555 --> 05:51:22.555
with muni and not drive when

05:51:24.460 --> 05:51:26.460
your kids have these, you know,

05:51:26.695 --> 05:51:29.297
hang ups about about getting
where they they need to go and

05:51:30.980 --> 05:51:32.934
then the other thing that really
hurts is hearing about any sort

05:51:33.936 --> 05:51:36.804
of constricting or whatever or
funding and whatever. And I will

05:51:37.739 --> 05:51:39.739
say once again, you've heard me

05:51:40.843 --> 05:51:42.911
say it before, are ppe this city
there you should never be

05:51:44.246 --> 05:51:46.246
parking for free in this city.

05:51:47.249 --> 05:51:50.151
we could essentially be doubling
the budget of the entire agency

05:51:51.453 --> 05:51:53.453
if we would put make every

05:51:54.122 --> 05:51:56.122
person pay for parking and then

05:51:56.959 --> 05:51:59.594
be charging a more market rate
for that. If you're worried

05:52:00.763 --> 05:52:02.763
about any legal things, throw in

05:52:03.499 --> 05:52:05.499
a free muni pass with it. Charge

05:52:05.868 --> 05:52:08.302
$1,200 a year for parking in our
streets and you get a free

05:52:09.572 --> 05:52:11.572
annual muni pass that I believe

05:52:12.107 --> 05:52:14.107
would help solve things and is

05:52:14.276 --> 05:52:16.276
we need the money. We should not

05:52:16.579 --> 05:52:18.579
be cutting transit. We need to

05:52:19.150 --> 05:52:21.150
be cutting down cars and I think

05:52:21.183 --> 05:52:23.183
that would help. Thanks thank

05:52:23.419 --> 05:52:25.587
you. Any other speakers in the
room? Seeing none. Please open

05:52:26.322 --> 05:52:28.490
the phone at this time. We'll
move to remote public comment

05:52:29.580 --> 05:52:31.126
not to exceed a total time of
ten minutes. Members of the

05:52:31.427 --> 05:52:33.896
public wishing to comment should
dial star three to enter the

05:52:34.731 --> 05:52:36.731
queue each speaker will have two

05:52:37.330 --> 05:52:39.330
minutes. Moderator first speaker

05:52:39.536 --> 05:52:41.536
great david paypal so I continue

05:52:42.772 --> 05:52:45.374
to converse regularly with sean
kennedy on more of the detail on

05:52:46.442 --> 05:52:48.442
this topic. Our next scheduled

05:52:49.450 --> 05:52:51.179
chat is this friday afternoon,
just as an example of some of

05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:54.717
the ideas that I have that we're
talking about, I support

05:52:56.687 --> 05:52:58.687
rerouting the 28 r to the golden

05:52:58.688 --> 05:53:01.357
gate bridge with the 28 local
bypassing the bridge during the

05:53:03.960 --> 05:53:06.929
day and to provide a connection
from the bridge to the presidio

05:53:08.933 --> 05:53:10.933
ultimate to connect to the

05:53:11.680 --> 05:53:13.680
marina. Some 29 sunset trips

05:53:13.504 --> 05:53:15.504
could be extended back through

05:53:16.340 --> 05:53:18.441
the presidio as is service used
to exist to improve those

05:53:19.745 --> 05:53:22.312
connections. As and I think I
can do that in a cost neutral

05:53:22.312 --> 05:53:25.281
way. Other proposals should be
considered, including some

05:53:26.517 --> 05:53:28.517
combining of route segments on

05:53:29.320 --> 05:53:31.320
the 18, the 23, the 54 and the

05:53:33.657 --> 05:53:35.657
58, the 66, the 37, the 35 and

05:53:37.161 --> 05:53:39.161
the 55. The 12 and the 27. And

05:53:39.496 --> 05:53:42.331
the most obvious isthe easiest
thing is the 22, which should

05:53:43.340 --> 05:53:45.340
have a long line, a short line

05:53:46.537 --> 05:53:48.537
pattern. And there are others I

05:53:48.573 --> 05:53:51.408
know and I think we all know
that we can have better service

05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:55.144
where riders need it for the
same or less cost using

05:53:56.414 --> 05:53:58.414
available staff and operator

05:53:59.783 --> 05:54:01.783
availability. So I support cost

05:54:02.253 --> 05:54:04.922
neutral resource reallocation on
that. John talked about. And to

05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:08.859
that end, I plan to continue
working with sean and others at

05:54:11.262 --> 05:54:13.430
mta on those efforts. I wanted
to conclude by saying once again

05:54:15.499 --> 05:54:17.634
thank you to director yasujiro
and for the record, I have

05:54:18.337 --> 05:54:20.337
nothing against the five fulton

05:54:20.605 --> 05:54:22.605
I've ridden it before. I will be

05:54:23.175 --> 05:54:25.175
on it again very shortly and

05:54:25.710 --> 05:54:27.710
finally, despite the level of

05:54:27.745 --> 05:54:30.581
division and strife in the world
today, I think this meeting,

05:54:31.349 --> 05:54:33.349
although long was quite civil

05:54:33.985 --> 05:54:36.821
and this is actually kind of a
model of how we can have

05:54:38.823 --> 05:54:40.823
civilized debate and discussion.

05:54:40.859 --> 05:54:43.694
So thanks for listening. Until
next time. Thank you. No

05:54:44.829 --> 05:54:46.829
additional callers. That's a

05:54:46.965 --> 05:54:48.965
great note to end on. Thank you,

05:54:50.468 --> 05:54:52.703
david paypal. All right. If
there are no further comments,

05:54:53.239 --> 05:54:56.174
we'll go ahead and adjourn this
meeting and I'd like to adjourn
the meeting in recognition of

05:54:56.909 --> 05:54:59.510
the service of our dear
colleague, director, we are

05:54:59.812 --> 05:55:02.447
going to MISS You very, very
much and we look forward to

05:55:02.481 --> 05:55:04.481
acknowledging you more fully at

05:55:06.566 --> 05:55:08.566
the next meeting. If you can

05:55:09.521 --> 05:55:11.521
commit to being there. Yes yes,

05:55:11.792 --> 05:55:13.792
we. Okay. Thank you, everybody.

05:55:31.344 --> 05:55:33.344
Good night.
