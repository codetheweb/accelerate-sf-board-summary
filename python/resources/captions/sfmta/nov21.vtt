the approval of minutes for the

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.196
NOVEMBER seven regular meeting
directors. There is one

00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:49.100
correction I'd like to make to
page three under item 10.2. The

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.737
minutes state that item 10.1 a
was removed from the consent

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:54.871
calendar and that should instead

00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.907
read that item. 10.2 a was

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.145
removed not 10.1 a thank you.
Thank you for that change.

00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:03.213
Directors, are there any other

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:05.682
changes to the NOVEMBER 7th

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:07.685
minutes? Seeing none, I'll open

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.210
public comment for anyone
attending the meeting in person

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.458
on the NOVEMBER 7th minutes and
seeing none. Please open a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.327
remote at this time. We'll move
to remote public comment not to

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.629

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:22.166

No speakers. Okay, we'll close

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.630
communications. I have none.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.000
Moving on to item number six
introduction of new or

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.970
unfinished business by board
members. Okay director

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.108
hemminger, please. Thank you,
MADAM Chair. Colleagues you MAY

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.210
have seen in the papers as I did

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.460
that according to one report, at

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250
least at this agency is owed

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.285
$200 million in unpaid parking

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.725
revenue, which is a lot of dough
. It's about a year's worth of

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:24.830
fare revenue pre-pandemic. And I
know you can't treat all of

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:28.301
that. $200 million in one lump,
but I think it would be helpful

00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.301
for the staff to develop some

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.808
kind of recovery plan. So that
we could repatriate as much of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760
that money. What for what it's

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.214
intended for, which is to help
subsidize our immune system,

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:46.486
among other things. And I think
it would be important.

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:48.487
Apparently the newspaper report

00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:52.259
only went back a few years to go
back as far as we can recover

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.630
the revenue and also to look at

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.366
other sources of revenue that we

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.836
MAY be owed. And I think it
would be a healthy exercise to

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.775
include those numbers as well.
They probably won't approach the

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.943
level for parking fines and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120
fees, but every little bit

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.217
helps. So that would be my
request for that plan to be

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.860
developed and for it to be

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:22.454
presented to this board as soon

00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:28.194
as we can muster the effort.

00:04:28.463 --> 00:04:30.464
Thank you. Director hemminger
director tomlin, is there

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:33.334
anything you want to say about
that right now? No. We'll be

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:36.304
happy to have staff put together
either a memo or a presentation,

00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:38.304
whichever is the board's

00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:42.542
pleasure. Thank you. Any other
items of new or unfinished

00:04:46.114 --> 00:04:48.114
business? Okay. If no more. I do

00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:51.152
have one item which was noticed
on our agenda, and this is just

00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:53.453
to let you all know, colleagues,

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:56.489
members of the public, that as

00:04:56.524 --> 00:04:59.226
we have noticed, the board will
be sunsetting remote public

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:01.829
comment effective JANUARY 1st,

00:05:02.765 --> 00:05:04.532
2024. This change is at the
direction of the mayor's office

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.801
for all boards and commissions

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.605
citywide. It's intended to
ensure a uniform public comment

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.375
policy. Consistent with that
which has been adopted by the

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:17.747
board of supervisors. It is also
intended to avoid the type of

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:20.682
disruptive issues that gave rise
to the board of supervisors

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.170
policy in the first place. I

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.420
know for the community that
loves to comment at these

00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:28.923
meetings and I know some of you
will not be happy with this

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.226
decision. So I just want to
remind you of all of the options

00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:34.694
available to you to share your

00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:37.432
opinion with the board. You MAY
always write your comment in
advance of the meeting and I

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:42.537
will encourage the further in
advance of the meeting, the more

00:05:42.638 --> 00:05:45.540
guarantee that the board will
see the comment in advance of

00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:49.100
the meeting. This board is very
committed to reading the public

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.313
comment letters that we receive.
So that is a very effective way

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.951
to get your opinion across. I
believe secretary silva, members

00:05:56.453 --> 00:05:58.921
of the public can also call in
and leave a voicemail that will

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.624
be transmitted to the board. So
that's also an option that you

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:05.494
have in advance of the meeting.
You MAY, of course, continue to

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:09.731
attend the board meeting in
person in this room to provide
public comment and I want to

00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:12.234
also let you all know that

00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:15.971
especially for those of you who
will be desiring to continue

00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:20.743
remote public comment, I as
chair, I'm going to be exploring

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.712
offering virtual office hours in
advance of the meeting starting

00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.249
in JANUARY. So that's an
opportunity additionally for you

00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:30.286
to share your views directly
with me. We're still working out

00:06:30.954 --> 00:06:32.922
some of the logistical details,
but that information will be

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.692
posted online soon. And then
finally, that accommodation for

00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:37.692
remote public comment will

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:40.329
continue to be made available
for those with disabilities

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:42.933
needing accomp adoption and
information about requesting

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:44.933
that disability accommodation

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:48.400
can be found on our agendas or
by reaching out to the board.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.674
Secretary, secretary silva. So
we look forward to seeing

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.410
everyone in person and

00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:55.677
continuing to hear from you

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.879
colleagues. Any comments or

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:01.115
questions on that item before I

00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:04.253
go to public comment. Okay.

00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:08.558
Please open. Let's invite public
comment from anyone in the room.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560
I do have one speaker card.

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:17.267
Richard rothman. Good afternoon,
commissioners. My name is

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.472
richard rothman and I just I
don't think all commissioners

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.540
are following this directive,

00:07:24.676 --> 00:07:26.676
but it's just really a

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.130
discrimination against people,

00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:34.184
people who have mobility issues
and seniors and people who live

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:38.550
out in the in the district. And
why can't this, you know, I've

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.790
been following this commission

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:42.927
for a very long time and why
can't this commission have

00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:45.896
meetings in the neighborhood?
Three of the commissioners live

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:49.599
in the richmond district. They
could have it at the richmond

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:53.703
rec center and or over in the

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:55.905
sunset. You know, so especially

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.509
like when we're talking about

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.213
the bus lines, the 28 and the

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.750
20, was it 28 and the 29 and

00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:09.152
gary, you know, they could have

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:11.889
had public comment, public
public meetings out in the

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.527
neighborhood and have them at
night. I can't see why staff

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:18.964
can't come out to the richmond.
Maybe they'll know. They'll

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.964
explore something new in the

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.366
city they haven't seen before.

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.368
So I really hope, you know, we

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.737
can get this mayor's directive,

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:31.143
but, you know, think of having
an alternative. I like the idea

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.577
of having virtual meetings, but

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.880
maybe have the meetings out in
the community and have the

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.615
meetings at night. You know, a

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:40.984
lot of people work out during

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.921
the day or have child care and
hard to come to the meetings. So

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.459
maybe have options of having
some kind of alternative

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.364
meetings. Thank you. Thank you
for your comment. Are there

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.567
other commenters in the room? Go

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.947
ahead, please. Hello hello. My
name is chaya french. I live in

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.950
san francisco and I'm the
transit organizing director at

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.187
senior and disability action.

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:19.458
And yeah, I appreciate that. It
sounds like this is not the

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:23.229
position that you all might have
chosen and that it's getting

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.567
carried down from the board of
supervisors. But I would ask you

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:32.538
to use whatever you can in your
power to give feedback to the

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:34.806
board of supervisors that this

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.910
is not a position that really
works for this board. I don't

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.411
think it really works for san

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:42.514
francisco government in general.

00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:48.200
I think we I think some of the
importance of remote public

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.855
comment is in giving a public

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.291
forum. So that all of us can

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.293
hear what the community is

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.695
thinking. And I appreciate the

00:09:57.732 --> 00:10:00.133
what you just laid out, but that
doesn't let the community know

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:04.202
sort of what the conversation is

00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:06.538
and that we're particularly

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.575
concerned because we are in
partnership with many

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.844
organizations and community

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.980
members and communities like

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.490
parents, working class people,

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.754
all people who can't make it to
parts of the city, people who

00:10:20.822 --> 00:10:22.822
might have of physical

00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:26.590
limitations, but yet don't want
to identify themselves publicly

00:10:27.862 --> 00:10:30.764
as disabled, and that there are
so many important things that

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:32.764
come before this board. And we

00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:34.901
really want our whole community

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:37.403
to be able to weigh in. Thank

00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:39.605
you. Thank you for your comment.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.679
Next speaker, please. Good

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
afternoon, commissioners. My

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.319
name is ty bash. I was actually
wasn't going to give public

00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:55.355
comment, but since we're talking

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.829
about this item, the ada
wheelchair accessible entrance

00:11:04.432 --> 00:11:06.432
on the east part of this

00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:08.468
building has been out of service

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.538
for I don't know how long. Eight
months ago, I was in this

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.941
building and I reached out to
the individuals who are taking

00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:16.943
care of maintenance, and they

00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:19.545
promised me that this will be

00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:22.783
taken care of expeditiously. I
was here today. It's still

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:26.221
broken. Not only that part of
the original assembly removed

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.460
the. The handrail, which means

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:35.529
that in order to come in through

00:11:35.597 --> 00:11:38.399
security, people need to crawl
down on all fours to go up the

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.100
stairs and I don't think that's

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:46.274
that's dignifying perhaps it's
you could delay remote access

00:11:47.877 --> 00:11:50.211
until some of these things are
fixed so people can come over to

00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:52.414
this building and actually
provide public comment. Thank

00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:56.116
you. Thank you. Next speaker,

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:04.959
please. Hi. Board members. Luke
bornheimer. I will admit that I

00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:08.696
am very torn on this. This item

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.733
and this change. As you all
know, I organize a lot of people

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:14.569
around car for jfk and great
highway and slow streets to make

00:12:15.304 --> 00:12:17.239
comment and many of those people
were able to engage because they

00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:20.377
were able to engage remotely,
whether it was at night because

00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:24.246
they had a kid at home or just
they had never engaged in the

00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:27.382
process at all. And people like
me made it really easy for them

00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:30.351
to engage in the process. I also

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.554
recognize that at many of the
equity issues and access issues

00:12:33.289 --> 00:12:35.289
with remote public comment are

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.827
the same with in-person comment.
It's still hard for people to

00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:40.595
learn about meetings. It's still

00:12:41.364 --> 00:12:44.660
hard for them to engage. So I
encourage you all the mayor's

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.350
office to figure out ways that

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.170
increase access, increase

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:51.874
awareness for the public, and
for people to engage in an

00:12:53.344 --> 00:12:56.179
equitable fashion. You know,
someone mentioned the public

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.313
comments that are sent in and

00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:00.950
the ability for people or spoken
for people to hear what other

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:04.387
people are saying. And so I
think something that could be
really great is for all

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.230
commissions in the city to be
releasing public comments that

00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:10.861
are emailed so that anyone can
see what is sent to a commission

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.620
or a board without having to a

00:13:13.264 --> 00:13:15.465
sunshine request that would
allow people I mean, that's just

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.401
good governance. That's just
good transparency for the public

00:13:19.703 --> 00:13:21.671
to see what's being said to
boards and commissions. So yeah,

00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:26.876
very torn on this. Obviously
this is coming down from the

00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:29.946
top, from the mayor's office. So

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.316
yeah, I don't know what the best
solution is here, but certainly

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:37.220
other cities, other countries
have figured out solutions that

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:41.124
are more equitable and increase
access without you know, bogging

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:43.659
down meetings and hours and

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:46.497
hours of public comment that
people like me organize. So

00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:50.834
thanks for your consideration.
Thank you. Any other speakers in

00:13:51.903 --> 00:13:54.771
the room? Okay if not, please
open a remote. Secretary silva.

00:13:54.873 --> 00:13:57.407
At this time, we'll move to
remote public comment. Not a

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:59.608
total time of ten minutes.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.378
Members of the public wishing to
comment should dial star three

00:14:02.814 --> 00:14:05.282
to enter the queue. Each speaker
will have two minutes. Moderator

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.530
for speaker. Hello, board

00:14:11.223 --> 00:14:13.190
members, I'm dylan papers, the
community and policy manager at

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:16.159
san francisco transit riders. We

00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:19.960
were disappointed to hear about
the decision to end remote

00:14:19.498 --> 00:14:21.565
public comment. Our remote
public comment offers an

00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:25.103
accessible option for folks who
are unable to attend each

00:14:25.237 --> 00:14:28.105
meeting in person, whether it be
for disability reasons or child

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.708
care reasons or work
obligations, or just for the

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:34.745
reason that I'm calling it
today, which is I'm out of town

00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:37.448
but still want to be able to
speak up publicly at these

00:14:38.584 --> 00:14:40.819
meetings. A lot of transit
riders are are not necessarily

00:14:42.822 --> 00:14:44.822
able to take time out of their

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.190
day to come down to city hall in

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.760
person and remote public comment

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.230
has given them a lot more

00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:56.167
opportunity to speak up about

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.710
the things that impact them. We
know that public transit is

00:15:00.273 --> 00:15:02.273
going to be a big part of

00:15:02.875 --> 00:15:05.744
meeting a lot of our equity and
climate goals in the city and

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:08.314
it's crucial to hear from the
people riding transit at sfmta

00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:10.481
board meetings, whether or not
they're able to get there in

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.840
person. It sounds like there is

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.654
maybe some hesitancy from this
board to implement this policy.

00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:18.624
So I hope you all can reconsider
and push back on the mayor's

00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:21.492
office's request. I do really

00:15:22.428 --> 00:15:24.428
appreciate the idea of virtual

00:15:24.464 --> 00:15:27.299
office hours and hope we can see
each board member adopt that

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.904
practice as well. I think that
could be a good way of getting

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:35.374
more of that direct feedback
from riders. Thank you all for

00:15:36.643 --> 00:15:38.643
your consideration and I hope

00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:41.479
you can reconsider and push back

00:15:41.847 --> 00:15:43.847
on the policy. Thank you. Next

00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:51.623
speaker. Herbert weiner. Now I

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.930
am living in assisted living. It

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:57.629
prohibits me from attending the

00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:01.633
meetings in person at and I

00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:03.801
think that the remote comment

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.606
for me is precious. On the other

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.430
hand, all means of access should

00:16:13.147 --> 00:16:15.915
be available for feedback back,
especially at this time. The

00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:18.917
muni proclaims it has serious

00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:23.890
problems with providing services
, so you need input from all

00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:27.459
sides in all ways. Now now the

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:30.629
reason why this prohibition has

00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:33.265
gone through is, is there's been

00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:35.334
hateful speech which we all

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.640
abhor in our right minds simply

00:16:40.942 --> 00:16:42.942
cutting off the speaker is the

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.790
way to do it that way. There is

00:16:47.248 --> 00:16:50.160
no problem. Someone says
something despicable. You would

00:16:50.918 --> 00:16:52.918
immediately discontinue him from

00:16:53.687 --> 00:16:55.755
speaking and you can do that by
cutting off the microphone,

00:16:57.292 --> 00:16:59.292
phone and cutting off the remote

00:17:00.428 --> 00:17:02.428
access to that party. It's as

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:07.234
simple as that. So so I suggest
you convey the sentiment to the

00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:12.672
mayor and also to the board of
supervisors. Thank you very

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:22.183
much. Thank you. Next speaker.
Jerry cannon directors. My name

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:25.286
is evan arabic and I'm the
advocacy manager at walk san

00:17:25.286 --> 00:17:28.122
francisco, allowing remote
public comment is an equity

00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:31.758
issue, but it is also a good
governance issue for many san

00:17:32.328 --> 00:17:34.328
franciscans coming to city hall

00:17:34.463 --> 00:17:36.497
on a tuesday afternoon for
potentially several hours is a

00:17:38.534 --> 00:17:41.335
tremendous challenge and often
simply impossible. We have jobs,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400
kids, transportation limitations

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.240
and physical disabilities.
Allowing remote public comment

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.978
means more people can at least
have the chance to have their

00:17:51.514 --> 00:17:53.681
voice heard, and that can and
that more can imagine juggling

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.152
responsibility in such a way
that they can contribute to the

00:17:57.553 --> 00:18:00.121
discussion even without remote
public comment, more people will

00:18:01.723 --> 00:18:03.357
be shut out of the conversation.
And that's indisputable. That's

00:18:04.326 --> 00:18:06.326
not only concerning from an

00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:09.331
equity lens. It should be
understood as a threat to good

00:18:09.399 --> 00:18:12.200
governance. When more voices are
heard, decision making is better

00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:14.236
informed and therefore
potentially more effective. The

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.570
public needs us and our

00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:18.806
constituents and members of the
vision zero coalition will

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.843
continue to raise our voices
through in-person public comment

00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:23.912
, sending in letters and also
showing up to speak because

00:18:24.881 --> 00:18:26.982
lives are on the line. And this
commission needs to hear from

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:31.719
people. Thank you. Thank you. No

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.391
additional callers. Okay. We
will close public comment.

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:39.227
Director hemminger, do you want
to speak again on this? Yes.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.498
Just briefly, first of all, to
compliment you, MADAM Chair, for

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.667
I kind of liked your your hybrid

00:18:45.902 --> 00:18:47.902
model for remote comment, so I'm

00:18:47.904 --> 00:18:49.904
going to be sorry to see it go.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.410
So secondly, I certainly want to

00:18:54.144 --> 00:18:56.378
endorse the idea of having all
of our future meetings in the

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.810
richmond district. But

00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:02.752
seriously, on that point, I
don't know whether this board

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.322
has a history of taking the show

00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:10.326
on the road, but that is one
way, I think, to interact with

00:19:11.228 --> 00:19:14.163
the community in a new fashion
in it's a lot of work and I'm

00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:16.731
especially looking at our

00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:18.801
commission secretary, but I

00:19:18.802 --> 00:19:21.304
think from time to time that
might be something we ought to

00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:26.776
consider doing. Thank you. Thank
you. Any other comments from my

00:19:31.515 --> 00:19:33.683
colleagues? Okay DR. Karina, I
just wanted to double click on

00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:36.285
that. I think that would be a

00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:39.422
wonderful practice to have. I
believe rec and park conducts
their meetings in that way. They

00:19:40.424 --> 00:19:43.600
go to different rec and park
sites and that's where they have

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.595
they host some of their
committee meetings. And so I

00:19:45.763 --> 00:19:47.763
think it's there's a precedent

00:19:48.399 --> 00:19:51.000
for it for sure. It is extra
work for christine. And so I'm

00:19:51.202 --> 00:19:54.171
curious to see what that looks
like. But I think that that

00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:57.106
would be a wonderful compromise

00:19:57.108 --> 00:19:59.108
to see how we can meet folks

00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:02.445
where they're at for sure.
Great. So I'm just going to go

00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:06.216
ahead and read the numbers
again. It's in the printed

00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:09.353
agenda, but if you want to call
in and leave a voicemail or

00:20:12.324 --> 00:20:14.325
request accommodation, it's
(415) 646-4470 or email mta

00:20:15.893 --> 00:20:18.796
board at sfmta.Com. And I will
say I'm also intrigued by the

00:20:18.863 --> 00:20:21.298
idea of having our meetings
rotate around to different parts

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:24.835
of the city. I recognize it's
more work. Director tomlin is

00:20:26.305 --> 00:20:29.730
glaring at me and the california
transportation commission rotate

00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:31.909
their meetings all over the
state of california to give

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.411
exposure to different parts of
the state. So I think it's

00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:36.479
something we should at least

00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:38.749
explore and look into you as
well as I'm sympathetic to the

00:20:39.684 --> 00:20:42.219
comment about the time of this
meeting at 1:00, and I know some

00:20:42.987 --> 00:20:45.123
other commissions change the
times of their meetings. So

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.891
these are all creative solutions

00:20:47.927 --> 00:20:50.610
and I thank members of the
public for trying to think

00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:53.300
creatively about how we can
adapt to this new guidance and

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.832
still provide meaningful
opportunity for public

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:57.234
engagement and specifically

00:20:57.803 --> 00:20:59.803
remotely. Let's move on to the

00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:02.541
next item, please places you on
item number seven, the

00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:08.980
director's report. Thank you,
christina and members of the

00:21:10.683 --> 00:21:12.683
board. My first item is

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.722
bittersweet. I want to recognize
sfmta government affairs
director kate breen. Upon the

00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.495
announcement of her retirement.
But kate will be retiring from

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:28.900
city government on DECEMBER
19th. Kate, do you want to come

00:21:29.502 --> 00:21:30.902
up while I flatter you about
your extraordinary

00:21:35.474 --> 00:21:37.676
accomplishments. Kate began I
don't even know if this is the

00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:40.679
beginning of your transportation
career, but no, I believe. No,

00:21:41.281 --> 00:21:43.281
no, no, no, no, no. But but

00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:46.418
kate, before joining the sfmta
has spent 11 years at the

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:48.919
metropolitan transportation

00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:50.988
commission where she was

00:21:51.324 --> 00:21:53.324
instrumental among many things

00:21:55.162 --> 00:21:57.163
in helping to ensure the passage
of the intermodal surface

00:21:59.232 --> 00:22:01.232
transport efficiency act of

00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:06.137
1991, an. Sounds like a long

00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:10.141
time ago after 11 years at mtc,

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.376
she joined the sfmta, where she

00:22:13.313 --> 00:22:15.313
has been for 22 two years. That

00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:17.349
is dedicated in to public

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.923
service and she has had really
extraordinary accomplishments

00:22:22.923 --> 00:22:24.923
here. Obviously, her

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.360
accomplishments as none of them

00:22:29.797 --> 00:22:32.665
are a result of her alone in
fact, one of the things that is

00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:34.867
so amazing about kate is the way

00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:37.169
she forms teams, including the

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.500
extraordinary team, all of whom

00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:43.576
are here today, including some
who have come back from leave

00:22:44.678 --> 00:22:47.581
just for this event. But kate
has formed teams in order to

00:22:48.316 --> 00:22:50.784
accomplish all kinds of
extraordinary legislation,

00:22:51.886 --> 00:22:53.820
everything from really your
first accomplishment at the

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.570
sfmta, which was helping to
ensure funding for the central

00:22:58.993 --> 00:23:01.794
subway project, in part by
establish ing the groundbreaking

00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:04.563
principle that allowed san

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.666
francisco's contribution local

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.603
contribution on the surface
component of the t third line to

00:23:12.473 --> 00:23:14.541
count as the local contribution
for federal funding for the

00:23:15.643 --> 00:23:17.911
subway portion of that line. A
principle that has been used

00:23:18.846 --> 00:23:21.749
again by the transbay joint
powers authority for helping to

00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:25.920
fund the for the portal project.
The downtown rail extension

00:23:28.356 --> 00:23:30.356
project. She is also helped get

00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:34.193
past that ab 101, which

00:23:34.195 --> 00:23:36.163
established the first trans it
only lane enforcement

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.267
demonstration program in the
state and then got that

00:23:40.569 --> 00:23:42.870
continued something that we rely
upon today in order to enforce

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:46.673
our our transit lanes through

00:23:49.244 --> 00:23:51.244
cameras and she has, among other

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.381
things, been for 12 years
working very, very hard on

00:23:56.819 --> 00:23:58.819
vision zero policy at the state,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920
notably helping to pass ab 43

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.526
assembly member friedman's bill
that gave san francisco the

00:24:06.428 --> 00:24:09.263
authority to lower speed limits.
And really one of I mean,

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:12.330
probably the crowning
achievement, which is after 12

00:24:13.402 --> 00:24:16.304
years of trying every single
year at the state legislature,

00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:20.408
legislature helping to get past
friedman's ab 645, which

00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:24.645
authorized finally speed safety

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.782
cameras in california. She's
also, in addition to leading

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.180
here locally and at the regional

00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:34.722
level, she has helped to uplift

00:24:35.158 --> 00:24:38.930
her counterparts all over the
state of california. She has

00:24:38.628 --> 00:24:40.629
been chair of the executive
committee at the california

00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:45.533
transit association and was one
of the key people who helped

00:24:45.534 --> 00:24:47.435
form the california city
transportation initiative, which

00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:50.371
is a coalition of the eight

00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:53.741
largest cities in california. I

00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:57.545
am going to MISS Kate's wise

00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:01.416
counsel and hard work dearly and
the only consolation that we

00:25:02.385 --> 00:25:04.385
have upon her departure is the

00:25:05.288 --> 00:25:07.288
extra ordinary team that she has

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:10.359
created who are ready to step up
in order to ensure a seamless

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.620
transition. Kate, would you like

00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:17.266
to say anything? I mean, amazing
. Thank you, jeff, for those

00:25:17.467 --> 00:25:19.467
amazing kind words, each of

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.770
those things that you cited were
such battles of their own. And

00:25:23.674 --> 00:25:25.975
of course, none of these things
are accomplished alone, as jeff

00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:28.543
mentioned. But also, if you look

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:31.140
behind who was leading on those,
it's san francisco legislators,

00:25:32.616 --> 00:25:34.918
right? Assembly member david
chiu, even when he was a

00:25:34.918 --> 00:25:37.853
supervisor for assemblywoman
fiona ma, senator scott wiener,

00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:42.457
all of these have been champions

00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:44.593
and many before them. I just

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.929
naming a couple and so the

00:25:47.198 --> 00:25:49.265
alignment and the commitment of
our delegation over the years

00:25:50.968 --> 00:25:52.969
has really made all of these
successes possible for this

00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:55.771
agency and for the city. And of

00:25:55.873 --> 00:25:58.508
course, congresswoman speaker
emerita nancy pelosi, who

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.610
battled on the floor of the

00:26:01.245 --> 00:26:03.613
house to get the language that
allowed that phase one, phase

00:26:04.215 --> 00:26:06.349
two match for the third street
light rail to count towards the

00:26:07.618 --> 00:26:09.618
central subway. So all of that

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.540
was amazing and fun. Love it.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.992
Love the work, love this agency,
love my team. And I just want to

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.228
acknowledge them here today on
the local government affairs.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.660
Chadwick lee, janet martinson
and joel ramos for state,

00:26:23.401 --> 00:26:26.169
regional and federal katy
angotti and monique webster. And

00:26:27.472 --> 00:26:30.307
on regulatory affairs, kathleen
saecularis and kathy broussard.

00:26:30.475 --> 00:26:32.475
And I don't think I've had a

00:26:33.245 --> 00:26:35.245
chance for y'all to meet them.

00:26:35.447 --> 00:26:37.615
Everybody is humble. Everybody
works their butt off, and we're

00:26:38.816 --> 00:26:41.552
all committed to the purpose and
the goals of this agency. And so

00:26:42.187 --> 00:26:44.187
I just want to acknowledge and

00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:48.524
give them a round of applause as

00:26:49.894 --> 00:26:52.363
. So I think I really just want
to make sure that I thank you as

00:26:53.866 --> 00:26:56.134
a board for giving me the
opportunity. This board is one

00:26:56.301 --> 00:26:58.769
of the most consistently
professional and informed boards

00:27:00.472 --> 00:27:03.174
that this city has. And while
it's changed in its purview from

00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:06.976
2001, when I came here to work

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.180
for muni and was living in the

00:27:10.583 --> 00:27:12.684
city, working for the city and
seeing it for all it was and

00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:15.553
then this board has really
evolved to be so comprehensive

00:27:15.788 --> 00:27:18.623
in the purview that you have
leadership and authority over as

00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:21.491
it relates to the streets as

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.950
well as muni. So thank you. I
can keep talking. I'll talk to

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.699
you guys individually at times,
but just thank you again. And I

00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:31.436
read something. Last thing I'll
say is there isn't retirement

00:27:32.471 --> 00:27:34.471
anymore. There's retirement

00:27:34.473 --> 00:27:37.208
dates. And so this will be my
first retirement. Let's just say

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.778
that and I look forward to
continuing to engage in in

00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:45.160
public work. So and I believe we
also have somebody here from the

00:27:45.218 --> 00:27:48.860
mayor's office who might want to
offer some words. Tom paulino,

00:27:54.627 --> 00:27:56.995
tom. Thank you, director tomlin,
chair ekin directors, MADAM City

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.640
attorney and MADAM Clerk, my

00:28:00.132 --> 00:28:02.468
name is tom paulino. I am the
liaison to the board of

00:28:03.303 --> 00:28:06.105
supervisors for mayor breed. I'm
not going to expand beyond what

00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:08.239
director tomlin had already said

00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:11.110
about kate, but as a point of
personal privilege. And one of

00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:14.613
the things I had the opportunity
and privilege to meet kate in my

00:28:14.647 --> 00:28:17.516
capacity when I was district
director for then assembly

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:21.287
member david chiu and me getting
up to speed on everything, no

00:28:22.623 --> 00:28:24.623
pun intended, related to the

00:28:24.624 --> 00:28:27.590
transit was made easy because of
you. Kate and I very much

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.160
appreciate all of your insight

00:28:29.162 --> 00:28:31.964
and all of your guidance that
you offered me and my team and

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.933
the assembly member over the
years. However, in my capacity

00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:37.101
today, and this is something

00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:39.705
that gives me a lot of joy and

00:28:39.775 --> 00:28:42.642
it is a great privilege to offer
. These are not given out willy

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.410
nilly. They are for the

00:28:45.412 --> 00:28:47.447
exceptional individuals or
organizations in the city that

00:28:47.447 --> 00:28:49.447
contribute both in terms of

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.218
public service and to their team
and to our constituents

00:28:53.488 --> 00:28:56.423
wholesale. But this is a
proclamation from mayor london

00:28:57.825 --> 00:28:59.825
and breed recognizing today, day

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.997
NOVEMBER 21st, 2023, as kate
breen day in the city and county

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:16.309
of san francisco. So. Right I

00:29:28.123 --> 00:29:30.123
think okay yeah.

00:29:30.258 --> 00:29:32.326
Okay. Kate, I'll just I'll just
note a lot of the

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.429
accomplishments have been cited,
but I'll just note that as I was

00:29:36.231 --> 00:29:37.798
reading through the materials,
specifically the legislative

00:29:40.768 --> 00:29:43.700
program for next year under the
vision zero section, we will

00:29:43.805 --> 00:29:45.372
continue to support efforts that
are consistent with san

00:29:45.874 --> 00:29:48.742
francisco's vision zero action
strategy, transformative policy

00:29:48.777 --> 00:29:51.512
agenda, which includes two
policy objectives that have now

00:29:52.714 --> 00:29:54.714
been achieved. Yes right. Check,

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.510
check. Lower speed limits and
speed safety camera

00:29:57.852 --> 00:29:59.852
authorization. I just remember

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.323
year after year, you coming to
the board. We're going to get it

00:30:02.323 --> 00:30:04.492
done. We're going to get it
done. And what a remarkable

00:30:05.227 --> 00:30:07.295
thing that you get to retire.
Now, having really checked off

00:30:08.263 --> 00:30:10.431
the box on our top legislative
priority. I hope you just feel

00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:14.102
so proud of that and that maybe
we can rename some of the speed

00:30:14.102 --> 00:30:16.670
safety camera infrastructure
after you as well. I don't know

00:30:17.172 --> 00:30:19.273
if director hemminger you want
to share any reflections from

00:30:20.108 --> 00:30:22.944
your time at mtc? I certainly
would, and today would be the

00:30:23.946 --> 00:30:26.648
day I got to be chatty because I
got a frog in my throat. So I

00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:28.949
apologize. Know, kate was

00:30:30.653 --> 00:30:33.154
already at mtc when I got there,
so GOD knows how long she had

00:30:33.922 --> 00:30:35.922
been working there before. And

00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:39.426
actually I had the job she has

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.230
here at the mta at mtc. So from

00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:45.867
that first day she and I have
been working together. That's

00:30:46.902 --> 00:30:49.804
true. And I'm glad that I was
able to catch up with the tail

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.342
end of her career here. As you
were certainly ending with a

00:30:55.345 --> 00:30:57.345
bang and not a whimper. And they

00:30:57.747 --> 00:31:00.582
say you should always leave your
audience wanting more. And

00:31:00.683 --> 00:31:02.683
that's just what you've done

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.319
with all of us, because we're

00:31:05.688 --> 00:31:07.688
used to success with you in

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.790
charge. So professionally and

00:31:10.726 --> 00:31:13.495
personally, this is a this is a
great day for me and you'll have

00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:16.632
plenty to keep you busy. You
could even get appointed to a

00:31:19.302 --> 00:31:20.936
transit board. What do you know?
So congratulate us. Thank you.

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:23.805
Thank you very much, stephen.

00:31:26.442 --> 00:31:28.442
Thank you. All right. Can I. All

00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:30.711
right. Moving along as perhaps

00:31:32.616 --> 00:31:34.616
some of you noticed last week

00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:36.885
was apec, which was a major

00:31:37.254 --> 00:31:39.254
event that involved all hands on

00:31:40.123 --> 00:31:43.920
deck effort by staff at the
sfmta. We'll be providing a more

00:31:43.894 --> 00:31:45.894
detailed report back later on,

00:31:46.896 --> 00:31:49.833
but I have to say how incredibly
proud I am of the agency staff

00:31:50.901 --> 00:31:52.901
for the job that they did,

00:31:53.871 --> 00:31:55.872
helping to make sure that san
francisco kept moving and

00:31:56.807 --> 00:31:58.807
avoided catastrophe. All week,

00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:02.343
many of my team worked 16 hour

00:32:03.847 --> 00:32:05.882
shifts every day. We had about a
thousand volunteers working as

00:32:07.952 --> 00:32:09.952
ambassadors, standing out in the

00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:12.956
rain all day long, not only
helping to provide directions to

00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:15.991
folks, but responding instant

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.360
early to changes in bus routing

00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:23.132
that we had to do to deal with
first amendment activity and

00:32:23.401 --> 00:32:26.136
other unexpected events that
were kind of constantly

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:29.840
occurring. In some ways, I feel
like the staff response to apec

00:32:33.578 --> 00:32:36.379
was a culmination of much of the
cultural change work that we've

00:32:37.281 --> 00:32:40.216
been doing over the last four
years, including how we had to

00:32:42.187 --> 00:32:44.187
come together during covid. This

00:32:44.556 --> 00:32:46.556
is an amazing team in any

00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:49.560
emergency and we were fortunate
that this emergency we actually

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.610
had the opportunity to plan for

00:32:52.664 --> 00:32:55.465
in advance. I could not be
prouder of the work that the

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.636
team has done and I'm sure
christine will forward to you. A

00:32:59.538 --> 00:33:02.506
little quick video that I did in
the field as I was running

00:33:03.575 --> 00:33:06.143
around on muni and my bike,
seeing how things were working

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:09.979
and checking in with my team and

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.150
telling them just how proud I

00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:15.452
was of them. So more details on
that later. I'm also next

00:33:16.588 --> 00:33:18.588
subject. Glad to announce that

00:33:18.691 --> 00:33:20.691
in fact, last week on NOVEMBER

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:22.759
15th, the mtc commission did

00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:24.729
vote to support the staff
recommendation for the

00:33:25.397 --> 00:33:28.199
allocation on of california
state transportation agency

00:33:31.203 --> 00:33:33.203
funding for the sfmta. The total

00:33:36.508 --> 00:33:38.508
comes. To $309 million and we

00:33:38.611 --> 00:33:40.645
are incredibly grateful to the
governor, to the state

00:33:41.213 --> 00:33:43.213
legislature and to the full mtc

00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:45.982
commission, along with its staff

00:33:46.185 --> 00:33:48.185
for making those recommendations

00:33:48.554 --> 00:33:51.457
. And now hopefully moving
forward with allocating them.

00:33:52.892 --> 00:33:54.892
Bree mcwhirter, our cfo, will be

00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:56.795
providing an update at our next
meeting on what that means for

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.499
our budget. But one thing I can
assure you is we still remained

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.340
in the worst financial crisis of

00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:07.639
our agency's history. But this
contribution buys us a

00:34:08.975 --> 00:34:11.543
significant amount of time to
continue our work at solving the

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.247
underlying structural problem.
It also makes sure that we do

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.218
not have to cut muni service
next year, and we are incredibly

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.288
grateful for that. Next up, I
wanted to provide an update also

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.900
on our regional efforts. And

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
this is on regional transit

00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:32.310
network management. At we as you
know, have been working since

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.199
the very beginning of covid to

00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:37.690
coordinate with all of the
transit operators in the region.

00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.671
And since the beginning of

00:34:40.674 --> 00:34:42.674
covid, every monday morning at 9

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:45.645
a.M, the general managers of the
larger agencies meet along with

00:34:46.346 --> 00:34:48.346
our staffs in order to

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.449
coordinate efforts and also to

00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:53.686
help figure out how do we make
the over all transportation

00:34:54.554 --> 00:34:56.554
system look like a single

00:34:58.558 --> 00:35:00.626
integrated system from a user
perspective? And how do we

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.532
communicate our needs for
dealing with the stuff at the

00:35:06.466 --> 00:35:09.235
edges where things are not as
connected as they should be? So

00:35:09.303 --> 00:35:11.638
we have been working
collaboratively only with staff.

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:15.475
The metropolitan transportation
commission, with several state

00:35:16.276 --> 00:35:18.276
legislators and all the

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.448
operators on a whole variety of
programs. And we're starting to

00:35:22.784 --> 00:35:24.784
really get some momentum now. So

00:35:25.386 --> 00:35:27.386
some of the key work from this

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.890
year include a successful first

00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:34.127
year pilot of the clipper bay
pass program. Phase one, which

00:35:37.265 --> 00:35:39.333
provides unlimited transit use
for our people at key

00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:42.769
institutions. Phase one included

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.973
academic institutions ans, like
santa rosa college and san

00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:49.509
francisco state university
collected a lot of data on that

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.110
and now mtc is moving on to

00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:54.981
phase two, which will include

00:35:56.418 --> 00:35:59.253
food a employer pass that can be
made available to all employers

00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:02.890
in the region. This is a
critical next step and something

00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:06.727
that MAY be a key component of
our larger regional funding

00:36:07.662 --> 00:36:10.564
strategy for dealing with the
fiscal cliff. We're also

00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:14.502
underway with a no cost and
reduced cost interagency

00:36:17.472 --> 00:36:20.441
transfer pilot project, which
caps the transfer penalty for

00:36:21.709 --> 00:36:24.245
folks who have to transfer, say,
between muni and bart or between

00:36:24.446 --> 00:36:26.446
ac transit and bart or muni and

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:29.416
samtrans so that people aren't

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.520
penalized just because they

00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:35.560
happen to live on the other side
of a county line. Again, an

00:36:36.125 --> 00:36:38.125
effort to make the system work

00:36:39.394 --> 00:36:41.428
from a user perspective as if it
were one single integrated

00:36:42.664 --> 00:36:45.533
system. We're also working
collaboratively with all of the

00:36:46.302 --> 00:36:48.302
agencies and mtc on a regional

00:36:48.604 --> 00:36:51.339
wayfinding strategy that
includes signage, whole

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800
wayfinding typology, system

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.711
mapping and other
characteristics so that again,

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.481
all of our collateral material
looks like it's a part of one

00:37:01.717 --> 00:37:03.717
system. And finally, we're

00:37:03.753 --> 00:37:05.753
working together as two

00:37:06.689 --> 00:37:09.358
operators in order to make sure
that we can ensure our and

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.161
maintain ties, timed transfers
at key transfer hubs among

00:37:14.864 --> 00:37:16.698
agencies. Staff have done some
extraordinary work on this

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.100
topic, including making us all

00:37:20.804 --> 00:37:22.905
suddenly realize that one of the
most critical elements of

00:37:22.939 --> 00:37:24.939
ensuring and maintaining time

00:37:27.177 --> 00:37:30.120
transfers is aligning the
operator sign up schedules in

00:37:31.347 --> 00:37:33.347
our labor agreements because

00:37:35.218 --> 00:37:38.153
that is the time at which we
adjust our schedules and it is

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.657
limited because our people who
work for our agencies need to

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.262
actually be able to plan their
lives and schedules for their

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:47.496
kids. And we realize that our
operator sign up schedules are

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.650
perfectly misaligned, but it is

00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:54.300
relatively straightforward thing
that we can do in order to

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.709
underpin in an effort to ensure
and maintain time transfers. We

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.777
are also working at the

00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:03.880
structural level in order to
bring all the operators together

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.715
in a more formal way. We have

00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:10.419
begun regular meetings of a new
region panel, network management

00:38:14.326 --> 00:38:16.693
committee at mtc. Mtc has hired
melanie choi as the first

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.628
regional network management

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.980
director. Because one of the
things that we realized of

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.990
course, is that if there's no

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:27.470
staff in charge of making it
happen, it is not going to

00:38:29.308 --> 00:38:31.308
happen. And in addition to that,

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.309
each of the operators is

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:36.413
offering seconded staff,
dedicated time in order to work

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.815
on these regional efforts in a

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.453
coordinated way. The regional
network management council,

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:46.955
which I am a member of, will

00:38:47.327 --> 00:38:49.327
host its first meeting on

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:53.396
tuesday, NOVEMBER 27th. This is

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:56.166
a meeting of all of the large
transit agency general managers,

00:38:57.102 --> 00:38:59.102
three small agency reps and the

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.871
mtc executive director. And at
our first meeting we will

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.907
discuss our year one work

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:07.911
program focused on customer

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:10.513
facing tanjil able outcomes in

00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:13.984
order to help not only make the
system work, but also build

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.353
trust with the electorate who we

00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:19.489
are reliant on for addressing

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:22.859
our financial challenges. So I

00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:25.729
am very proud to have helped

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.650
lead these efforts over the last

00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:30.301
couple of years and to see that
they are finally bearing fruit

00:39:31.837 --> 00:39:34.805
and also grateful for yet again
for our government affairs team,

00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:37.607
for their strong support in

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:40.578
making all of this happen. And
finally, I want to provide an

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.115
update on valencia street,
something that has been in the

00:39:44.283 --> 00:39:47.185
news a lot, and staff are
working hard on. As you know, we

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.923
are currently having a pilot
program underway in order to

00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:54.558
achieve goals of advancing

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.860
cyclist and pedestrian safety on

00:39:56.862 --> 00:39:58.862
valencia street and ensuring

00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:01.800
that we maintain good emergency
vehicle access and supporting

00:40:02.702 --> 00:40:04.702
small business success in a

00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.904
challenging economic time for

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.720
san francisco. We have obviously

00:40:10.976 --> 00:40:12.977
heard a lot from pedestrian and
cyclist advocates. We're also

00:40:13.746 --> 00:40:15.746
hearing a lot from small

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.784
business owners and so we are
continually making adjustments

00:40:20.587 --> 00:40:23.550
based upon what we hear in order
to advance safety and in order

00:40:25.158 --> 00:40:27.158
to help the small businesses. So

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.328
one of the things that we did
early in the program is to make

00:40:30.897 --> 00:40:32.897
sure that the critical

00:40:33.233 --> 00:40:35.868
commercial loading functions
that had been happening in the

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.771
bike lane, that those functions
could be accommodated at the

00:40:40.607 --> 00:40:42.607
curb and that effort was

00:40:44.144 --> 00:40:46.211
successful. However, many of the
small business owners are

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:49.913
concerned that we have been too

00:40:50.184 --> 00:40:53.520
successful with that goal and
too much customer and employee

00:40:54.321 --> 00:40:57.256
parking has been removed in
order to make that happen. So

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.159
the team has been making a lot
of observations of the street

00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:02.294
and talking to small business

00:41:02.763 --> 00:41:04.930
owners and is working now at
fine tuning the dials on the

00:41:07.168 --> 00:41:10.360
loading zones so that the hours
of enforcement for the loading

00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:13.540
zones better match the need and
that those loading zones can be

00:41:14.241 --> 00:41:16.241
converted into customer parking

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.410
when they're not needed for

00:41:18.946 --> 00:41:20.946
loading. So the team is now

00:41:20.948 --> 00:41:23.583
working on a lot of changes and
adjustments to the loading zone.

00:41:24.284 --> 00:41:26.987
Signs the hours of enforcement
eliminating some zones where

00:41:27.923 --> 00:41:30.524
they're clearly not needed in
order to make sure again that we

00:41:31.692 --> 00:41:34.600
can optimize across all of these
goals, particularly around

00:41:34.695 --> 00:41:36.695
safety and small business

00:41:36.764 --> 00:41:38.764
success. We're also working in

00:41:39.266 --> 00:41:41.266
order to make sure more people

00:41:41.669 --> 00:41:43.669
know about the hoff street and

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:47.508
mission. Bartlett garages as
places where customers can park

00:41:49.377 --> 00:41:52.312
and will continue to make small
adjustments while we do our

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.915
larger and more formal
evaluation that will be coming

00:41:58.719 --> 00:42:00.719
to you with in early 2024. And

00:42:02.591 --> 00:42:04.591
that it is my director's report.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.600
Thank you, colleagues. Are there

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.630
questions for director tumlin?

00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:14.734
Okay okay. Seeing none right now

00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:17.837
, let's open to public comment
for anyone in the room on the

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.480
director's report. And board

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.150
members. Luke bornheimer I'll
keep my comments focused on

00:42:33.455 --> 00:42:35.455
valencia street. I am

00:42:35.524 --> 00:42:37.524
disappointed to see the agency

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.495
investing more time and energy
on the center bikeway design

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.432
that has resulted in many more
people crashing and being

00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:47.934
injured and MAY have also

00:42:47.936 --> 00:42:49.936
resulted in businesses getting

00:42:50.505 --> 00:42:52.505
less business. There is a

00:42:52.942 --> 00:42:55.430
mountain of data that shows that
curbside protected bike lanes as

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.770
well as pedestrianization of a

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.782
street would greatly benefit
businesses if we were a

00:43:02.952 --> 00:43:04.952
visionary city with a mayor who

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.188
had a vision, we would be
installing one of those things

00:43:07.923 --> 00:43:09.923
and addressing the business

00:43:09.926 --> 00:43:12.561
needs. Making the streets safer
for people and helping our

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.930
businesses recover. So I

00:43:16.398 --> 00:43:18.600
continue to be disappointed that
the agency hasn't created a

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.680
design for curbside protected

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.238
bike lanes or pedestrianization.
they've only created just simple

00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:28.609
mocks and as a result, agency

00:43:28.612 --> 00:43:30.612
staff have continued to tell the

00:43:30.814 --> 00:43:32.914
public that if the current
center bikeway was removed that

00:43:33.683 --> 00:43:35.684
we would have to go back to
paint only unprotected bike

00:43:35.818 --> 00:43:37.818
lanes, which of course nobody

00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:41.123
wants this. This lack of an
alternative design leaves us in

00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:43.792
a really vulnerable situation
where if something tragic

00:43:45.228 --> 00:43:48.130
happens, we have to remove the
center bikeway and go back to

00:43:48.598 --> 00:43:50.598
what we all don't want to go

00:43:51.735 --> 00:43:54.237
back to. So I implore you to ask
staff to urge staff to create

00:43:54.237 --> 00:43:57.390
designs, official designs,
complete designs for those

00:43:59.342 --> 00:44:01.342
options so that if we do need to

00:44:01.444 --> 00:44:03.646
remove the center bikeway, we
have something to go to. And in

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:07.383
case you didn't know, there is a
design for curbside protected

00:44:07.451 --> 00:44:10.253
bike lanes between 19th and
cesar chavez from 2020, it is a

00:44:13.479 --> 00:44:14.894
complete design, including dutch
style protected intersections.
So the only part that needs to

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:18.600
be designed is between 15th and
19th. Thank you so much. Thank

00:44:18.962 --> 00:44:20.962
you. Any other speakers in the

00:44:22.333 --> 00:44:24.467

aitken and mta board members.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.720
This is my open message to kate.

00:44:44.722 --> 00:44:47.624
I worked in government affairs
also and although I could not

00:44:48.325 --> 00:44:50.393
physically be there today, I
didn't want to MISS The

00:44:50.494 --> 00:44:53.429
opportunity to congratulate kate
you on your amazing career

00:44:54.799 --> 00:44:57.768
achievements as mta government
affairs director. Thank you for

inclusiveness, integrity,

00:45:03.341 --> 00:45:05.341
mentorship, excellence and

00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:07.376
teamwork. I've never been so

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.913
honored to work with such an
amazing group of people, and

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.470
it's due to your effortless

00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:14.952
leadership and integrity. I've
learned from you. You don't have

00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:18.321
to be great to start, but you

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.691
have to start to be great. Thank
you for your grit, grind and

00:45:21.659 --> 00:45:24.394
greatness. Thank you for always
allowing all of our voices to be

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:27.564
heard and most importantly, I
will MISS Knocking on your

00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:30.335
window even when you're on a
meeting and you still turn it

00:45:31.236 --> 00:45:34.710
around with a big smile and
waving at me. Thank you, kate.

00:45:35.841 --> 00:45:37.841
Enjoy your new journey and job

00:45:37.843 --> 00:45:40.578

you. Thank you. Next speaker.

00:45:52.191 --> 00:45:54.425
Hello good afternoon. This is
barry toronto. I want to

00:45:57.329 --> 00:46:00.298
congratulate kate green on her
first retirement. And I wish her

00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:04.934
luck in her her next next

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.400
endeavors before she retires

00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:11.643
again. I just I think she's
accomplished a lot. Too bad she

00:46:11.777 --> 00:46:13.777
she wasn't able to get the

00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:17.849
legislature to allow the city to
regulate tax or to have some

00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:20.851
control over them. The next

00:46:20.854 --> 00:46:22.854
topic is apec. Apec was a

00:46:24.757 --> 00:46:26.757
disaster for cab drivers. There

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.828
were a lot of at night and
couldn't access the union square

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.331
transit lanes. I will address
that more during my regular

00:46:34.367 --> 00:46:36.367
public comment and we didn't. We

00:46:38.137 --> 00:46:40.306
didn't we did horribly except
for the two days after the

00:46:41.207 --> 00:46:43.207
conference when the security

00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:46.177
personnel all used taxis to head

00:46:48.414 --> 00:46:50.516
back to washington, dc, so that
was extremely helpful. Some of

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.850
the hotels, except that having

00:46:53.486 --> 00:46:56.455
access to them were blocked. The
cab vans were blocked in some

00:46:57.991 --> 00:46:59.992
cases. So hopefully for the
christmas holiday season we can

00:47:02.229 --> 00:47:04.229
work something out and also

00:47:05.332 --> 00:47:07.332
finally and not least about the

00:47:07.934 --> 00:47:10.135
valencia street. It'd be great
if you took away the center

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.571
lane. I've had to go in there
several times late at night due

00:47:13.973 --> 00:47:15.975
to the blockage by garbage
trucks and garbage trucks need

00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:18.911
to do their job. But we also

00:47:19.179 --> 00:47:21.179
need to do our job as well. And

00:47:23.584 --> 00:47:26.452
encountering a garbage truck in
the middle of the block is can

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.870
be a problem at times. Thank you

00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:32.791
very much. Thank you know

00:47:34.662 --> 00:47:36.830
additional callers. Okay. Thank
you. Unless there are comments

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.499

director's report we can move on

00:47:41.435 --> 00:47:43.435

00:47:46.373 --> 00:47:48.474

00:51:14.585 --> 00:51:16.585
My name is walter vicente mejia,

00:51:18.222 --> 00:51:20.222
and I am part at winstone for 20

00:51:20.825 --> 00:51:22.893
and I've been part there for
three years. The reason is that

00:51:25.663 --> 00:51:27.663
I don't have the money to pay a

00:51:28.466 --> 00:51:31.100
rent. I lived there with my son.
My son is coming here. His name

00:51:33.638 --> 00:51:35.638
is nathan stanley mejia. He is

00:51:35.644 --> 00:51:37.644
22 years old. He works as a

00:51:39.277 --> 00:51:41.277
dishwasher. And I work for uber.

00:51:41.413 --> 00:51:43.413
And I hope that we can find

00:51:45.116 --> 00:51:47.116
parking for the whole community

00:51:47.118 --> 00:51:49.118
because there's many accidents

00:51:50.355 --> 00:51:52.322
there. And they come late at
night knocking at your door

00:51:53.725 --> 00:51:55.725
about a month and a half or two

00:51:55.727 --> 00:51:57.727
months ago, there was an

00:51:59.631 --> 00:52:01.631
accident and my glass, my window

00:52:02.501 --> 00:52:04.501
was broken. That happened around

00:52:05.704 --> 00:52:07.704
11, 1130 at night. And there is

00:52:08.173 --> 00:52:10.441
many arabs that are throwing
there's like water explosions

00:52:13.679 --> 00:52:15.679
and that's why I'm here today,

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.718
because I hope that we can find
some kind of special parking for

00:52:22.454 --> 00:52:24.454
us. So that's why I'm here, to

00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:30.493
see if you can do that for us.

00:52:32.265 --> 00:52:34.265

I live on mission drive. I've
been there for about a year and

00:54:42.263 --> 00:54:44.263
a half. I live alone and I don't

00:54:44.799 --> 00:54:46.799
have the means to pay for rent

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.680
all by myself. That's why I got

00:54:49.838 --> 00:54:51.838
a motor home where I can have

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:55.750
some dignity. And then in that

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:57.845
way, I can. I'm able to pay all
of my bills and have an okay

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.715
life. We have good neighbors
there. We are not the type of

00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:04.717
people that get in trouble. We

00:55:05.453 --> 00:55:07.453
don't have any problems. So I'm

00:55:07.556 --> 00:55:09.556
asking I'm here to ask for the

00:55:10.259 --> 00:55:13.161
board to give us more time to
find a solution, to get another

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.620
place to live, a better place.

00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:18.731
So I'm asking for the city also

00:55:20.135 --> 00:55:22.135
to maybe help us in any way

00:55:22.237 --> 00:55:24.237
possible. I would like to thank

00:55:37.586 --> 00:55:39.586
you. Next speaker. Bravissimo.

00:55:41.824 --> 00:55:43.824

00:56:55.299 --> 00:56:57.299
Okay obrigado. Good afternoon.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.690
My name is leandro lewis. I live

00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:03.471
in on winston drive at a motor

00:57:04.407 --> 00:57:07.343
home. I've been there for about
a year and a half with my wife

00:57:09.247 --> 00:57:11.414
kelly. We are living there.
We're living in this motor home

00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:14.718
because we don't have the means
to pay for rent, especially

00:57:15.786 --> 00:57:17.786
because rents are very high now,

00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:22.357
now and so we are we feel safe

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.794
there. I feel safe with my wife
there. She can go out in the

00:57:25.629 --> 00:57:28.165
morning and come back in the
evening, even when it's dark and

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.500
I feel safe about that. So we

00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:34.571
are there because we don't have
another place to go. We would

00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:37.373
love to be able to rent an
apartment and everything, but we

00:57:38.676 --> 00:57:40.676
just don't have the means to do

00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:43.446
that. And so we don't know what
to do. We are if we're asked to

00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:48.285
move out, we don't know where to
go. We don't have a place to go

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.355
and we don't know what to do.
That's why I'm asking for help.

00:57:55.493 --> 00:57:57.493
Thank you. Thank you. Additional

00:57:57.795 --> 00:58:00.363

My name is person. I am married.

00:58:59.892 --> 00:59:01.892
I live in an rv with my wife and

00:59:02.662 --> 00:59:04.596
children and we live there
because we don't have means to

00:59:07.666 --> 00:59:09.666
pay rent. Our income is very low

00:59:09.735 --> 00:59:11.735
and we just don't have another

00:59:11.871 --> 00:59:13.871
place to go if we're asked to

00:59:14.107 --> 00:59:16.374
move out, we won't know what to
do. We just don't have another

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.280
place to go. That's it. Thank

00:59:25.685 --> 00:59:27.685
you. Additional speakers. They

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.220
might as well. Preciso de

00:59:34.494 --> 00:59:36.629
through this item if we require
if there are any additional

00:59:37.397 --> 00:59:39.397
members of the public who want

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.100
to speak, I can move to then our
speaker cards. I have speaker

00:59:43.135 --> 00:59:45.135
cards for flo kelly and richard

00:59:46.507 --> 00:59:48.507
rothman. You can approach the

00:59:48.909 --> 00:59:50.909
podium now and then we can

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.412
perhaps start with the line
that's forming on the side.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.322
After that. Good afternoon
again. My name is richard

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.490
rothman. I live in the outer

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.128
richmond. Or as your staff likes
to call it, the county. You can

01:00:10.631 --> 01:00:12.631
ask them why they call the outer

01:00:12.733 --> 01:00:15.301
richmond, the county. But I live
off of fulton street. I live

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.700
near 37th and fulton. And this

01:00:19.506 --> 01:00:21.640
is a very dangerous intersection
in there. I've gone to the

01:00:23.611 --> 01:00:25.611
engineer spring street committee

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.480
a number of times to ask all I'm

01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:31.517
asking is that the signal light

01:00:31.952 --> 01:00:34.654
when the light turns, turns
green, that the countdown signal

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.458
goes on automatically because if

01:00:41.495 --> 01:00:44.640
it doesn't, it's a shorter time
to walk. And I've seen seniors

01:00:45.366 --> 01:00:47.968
not pressing the countdown time.
And even with the countdown,

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.771
even when I press the countdown
time, I can barely make it

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.400
across the street. So it needs

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.778
to be lengthened. There's been a

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.810
death at the intersection.
There's been a person who ended

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.652
up in the icu and now that the
street division is going to be

01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:08.921
getting new leadership, it's

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:11.457
time to change. And, you know,

01:01:11.492 --> 01:01:13.492
the nine years that I've been

01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:15.729
following it, it hasn't changed.

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.634
It needs to be more. More

01:01:23.171 --> 01:01:26.400
service to the more response to
the community needs. You know, I

01:01:27.742 --> 01:01:30.430
pay my taxes and I expect to
have the streets safe where I

01:01:32.948 --> 01:01:35.383
can walk and that's mta job is
to make the streets where I can

01:01:38.554 --> 01:01:40.554
walk. And also each departments

01:01:40.856 --> 01:01:42.856
don't talk to each other for the

01:01:42.891 --> 01:01:44.891
street, the street division,

01:01:45.894 --> 01:01:48.429
engineering took out a blue zone
and they didn't even tell the

01:01:49.398 --> 01:01:51.398
color code. I had to tell a

01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:55.170
color code to put in a new new
blue zone. That's not right.

01:01:56.405 --> 01:01:58.306
When they take out a blue zone,
they should put another one in

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.541
at the same time. So so I hope

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.610
to see some changes. Thank you

01:02:04.279 --> 01:02:06.279
very much. Thank you. Could we

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.900
have the next speaker, please.

01:02:20.196 --> 01:02:22.163
Hello I'm flo kelly and I work
with the coalition on

01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:24.798
homelessness and the stop

01:02:26.302 --> 01:02:28.737
poverty coalition. And I'm a
firm believer in team building

01:02:32.775 --> 01:02:34.775
and as and I can see how

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.382
important it is to make headway.
So one of the things that we

01:02:41.685 --> 01:02:43.685
would love to do is build more

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.991
teamwork with with mta the
staff, the board, you know, I

01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:54.129
don't think we should be arguing
with each other. I think we

01:02:55.965 --> 01:02:57.965
should figure out ways to come

01:02:59.269 --> 01:03:01.269
together and help everyone who's

01:03:04.608 --> 01:03:06.608
in great need. So I'm obviously

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:08.910
here for winston and all the

01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:13.382
folks that live on it. The last
time I counted there was like 48

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920
rvs that are there. So a four

01:03:20.157 --> 01:03:22.157
hour limit would really misplace

01:03:23.894 --> 01:03:25.894
a lot of people and I'm here for

01:03:26.396 --> 01:03:29.332
everyone, but I want to point
out one person who we have met

01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:36.372
named hamlet lee calderon. She

01:03:37.174 --> 01:03:39.174
wanted to be here today. But six

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.510
months ago, she got hit by a

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.815
muni bus and she had a medical
appointment. Today and that's

01:03:47.217 --> 01:03:49.217
going to be true of the next

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
board meeting that you have,

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:54.358
DECEMBER 15th. So since that
time, she's not been able to

01:03:57.762 --> 01:03:59.762
work and she has her family

01:04:00.164 --> 01:04:02.164
living with her in her rv on

01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:06.135
winston. And it it's really
important that we look at this

01:04:11.175 --> 01:04:13.175
as you know, people who who are

01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:18.215
marginalized and really because
we need their their work but

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160
they're not being paid enough in

01:04:23.254 --> 01:04:25.355
this very expensive city. Thank
you. Thank you. Next speaker,

01:04:26.992 --> 01:04:28.593
please. I do have more speaker
cards. Javier bremond, eliana

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.670
binder moose venmo. Mario smith.

01:04:38.136 --> 01:04:40.337
Good afternoon. My name is
eliana binder and I'm the policy

01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:44.207
manager for glide. Since this

01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:47.178
board voted on SEPTEMBER 19th to
approve for our parking limits

01:04:47.412 --> 01:04:50.248
on winston drive and buckingham
way, we have redoubled our

01:04:52.284 --> 01:04:55.860
efforts to partner with hsh to
secure housing and a safe

01:04:55.254 --> 01:04:57.488
parking site for the community
of dozens of families, students

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.590
and seniors who cannot afford

01:05:00.726 --> 01:05:03.295
the bay area's high rents and
are living in rvs on winston

01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:05.696
drive and buckingham way. This

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.000
community has been stressed,
anxious, confused about what

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:13.738
will happen and where they will
go. Since they will not be able

01:05:13.739 --> 01:05:15.739
to leave work or school to

01:05:15.808 --> 01:05:18.900
regularly move their vehicles to
comply with the parking limits

01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:20.110
and avoid ticketing and towing.

01:05:21.214 --> 01:05:23.348
We are grateful that this board
agreed to delay, implement ation

01:05:24.283 --> 01:05:26.151
of the parking limits for three
months until DECEMBER 19th.

01:05:27.587 --> 01:05:30.121
However as that date approaches,
the city has not yet been able

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:33.910
to establish a safe parking site
or connect everyone with

01:05:33.926 --> 01:05:35.926
housing. Therefore, we are

01:05:35.962 --> 01:05:37.962
respectfully urging you to delay

01:05:38.331 --> 01:05:41.134
implementation if the families
living in rvs are displaced and

01:05:41.134 --> 01:05:43.669
scattered after the parking
limits start, it becomes

01:05:44.504 --> 01:05:46.838
extremely difficult to support
and connect people with

01:05:47.774 --> 01:05:49.774
resources. When their lives have

01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:52.770
been destabilized and they
cannot be reached in a certain

01:05:53.614 --> 01:05:55.614
set location. So supervisor

01:05:55.615 --> 01:05:58.417
melgar's office and I have been
working on a safe parking site,

01:05:59.252 --> 01:06:01.420
as have we. We have also been
trying to connect people with

01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:05.491
housing, but we need more time.
There are hundreds of homeless

01:06:06.192 --> 01:06:08.594
families in san francisco
desperately waiting for shelter.

01:06:08.728 --> 01:06:10.796
It does not make sense to
displace this community and

01:06:11.665 --> 01:06:14.600
destabilize these families
before they can access housing.

01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:17.903
A safe parking site and
continued housing connections

01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:20.720
will help avoid the worst
outcomes of these parking

01:06:20.874 --> 01:06:22.874
restrictions and provide these

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:25.878
families with the dignity and
stability that they deserve.

01:06:26.779 --> 01:06:29.140
Please give us more time so that
we can work on real solutions.

01:06:32.153 --> 01:06:34.153
Thank you. Thank you. Next

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.610
speaker, please. Hello,

01:06:45.465 --> 01:06:48.201
directors. My name is sheba van
dba. I'm a policy associate with

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.870
glide and a member of the end

01:06:51.305 --> 01:06:53.773
poverty coalition. I I'm here
today because I'm deeply

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.760
concerned about the impact of
this looming for parking

01:06:56.811 --> 01:06:58.811
restriction on winston

01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:01.681
buckingham way as we stated
before to you all, this location

01:07:02.316 --> 01:07:04.952
is currently a place where
community of monolingual,

01:07:05.887 --> 01:07:07.887
spanish speaking and portuguese

01:07:08.623 --> 01:07:10.623
residents have resided since the

01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:13.359
pandemic. They need and they

01:07:15.443 --> 01:07:17.764
deserve our community support
from all of us to get them to a
place of stability. San

01:07:19.133 --> 01:07:21.836
francisco has a limited family
shelter and affordable housing,

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.706
and it can take time to access.
So we ask this board to consider

01:07:26.374 --> 01:07:29.430
delaying implementation of these
parking restrictions. As

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.770
community advocates, we've been

01:07:32.814 --> 01:07:35.820
working all the angles possible
to make sure that these families

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.584
are not displaced through
enforcement vehicle. Our

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.289
homelessness is not isn't
something isn't only impacting

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.289
this already vulnerable

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:45.920
community, but many across the
city. The state and this nation.

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:50.970
We appreciate those of you who
have made an effort to work with

01:07:50.365 --> 01:07:53.300
us to uplift this issue. And we
extend an invite to others who

01:07:53.368 --> 01:07:55.368
understand how detrimental this

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.600
issue is. We urge all city
departments supporting people

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.740
experiencing homelessness and

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:03.110
economic difficulties to
collaborate with one another and

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:07.820
to partner with cbos community
based organizations that are

01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:09.182
serving those communities in

01:08:09.217 --> 01:08:11.385
need. And please do not let
these families scatter, which

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.457
will take and make make it

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.660
harder for asians to find them
and support them in finding

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.950
alternative options that meet

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.432
their needs. We're asking for a
delay in implementation until a

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.669
safe parking site or housing
options are made available to

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:30.937
this community. Thank you. Thank

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.380
you. Next speaker, please. Good

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.652
afternoon. Chair and directors.
My name is javier bermont and

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.720
I'm an organizer with the
coalition on homelessness and

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.490
also part of the end poverty

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.162
coalition. And yeah, I just want
to echo what's been said already

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:56.531
is that I strongly urge that

01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:01.169
this board, you know, put the
parking restrictions on the

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.174
agenda before for the 19th and,

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.477
and continue to delay the

01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:11.580
implementation of these parking
restrictions because as we've

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.784
heard from folks, we would be
quite literally towing folks

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.540
homes away at. And, you know, i

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.857
think what we're coming out as a

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:25.995
public to say today is that we
don't want bureaucratic

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:28.130
indifference to be the reason

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:31.768
why we have dozens of people,
you know, descend further into

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.737
homelessness like they're
already in a really precarious

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.675
situation housing wise. And what
we're what we're asking, you

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:43.946
know, as a community is that we
just have a little bit more time

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:47.550
so we can do what we set out to
do. And what we tried to agree

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:50.687
on in SEPTEMBER, which is that
we need time to get people

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:54.991
housed and we need time to get a
safe parking site. And if we're

01:09:55.893 --> 01:09:57.893
this close to actually getting

01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:00.329
people the support and the

01:10:00.464 --> 01:10:02.332
access to housing that they need
, then we shouldn't just let the

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.100
deadline expire and put people

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:09.973
out on the street. So I really
strongly urge today that the mta

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:16.179
board votes to delay the parking
restrictions for winston drive

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.683
and buckingham way. Thank you.
Thank you for your comment. Next

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.230
speaker, please. Good afternoon.

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:30.761
Boards and chairs. My name is
mario smith. I'm with the

01:10:30.761 --> 01:10:33.463
coalition on homelessness and
the stop poverty toes coalition.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:37.101
I'm here to ask what everyone
else has been asking. MAY we

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:40.270
please get more time concerning

01:10:40.572 --> 01:10:42.572
this ordeal? The moment that the

01:10:42.607 --> 01:10:44.607
moment the parking meters goes

01:10:44.876 --> 01:10:46.810
up, as they said, all the
families will scatter. The work

01:10:47.545 --> 01:10:49.545
we've been doing with them will

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.140
all be for naught. And I would

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.850
we simply need more time as

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.220
everyone's already said, I'm

01:10:57.923 --> 01:10:59.923
here to echo and add to that

01:10:59.925 --> 01:11:02.393
voice. But please, guys, we need
more time for the families

01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:07.297
specifically. Yeah it's as

01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:09.499
simple as that. Thank you for

01:11:09.902 --> 01:11:11.902
your time. Thank you for your

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.760
comment. Next speaker, please.
Good afternoon, board members.

01:11:19.611 --> 01:11:21.746
My name is goulet moussa. I am
the community engagement manager

01:11:21.847 --> 01:11:23.847
with the episcopal community

01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:26.316
services and also a member of

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.860
the end poverty toes coalition.

01:11:29.422 --> 01:11:31.422
I want to express our solidarity

01:11:31.991 --> 01:11:33.991
with the residents and their

01:11:35.327 --> 01:11:38.163
call for an extension on winston
drive and buckingham way. I urge

01:11:38.931 --> 01:11:41.833
that you consider this matter
with utmost urgency and

01:11:43.503 --> 01:11:45.503
compassion. This community is in

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.541
dire need of a tangible solution
to house them or provide a safe

01:11:48.541 --> 01:11:50.642
site for their rvs to park
without fear of fines and

01:11:50.943 --> 01:11:53.212
displacement. To start finding
this community will only

01:11:53.212 --> 01:11:55.881
exacerbate their financial
struggles and displacement,

01:11:56.382 --> 01:11:58.382
especially during the holidays.

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.887
We kindly request that you put
the extension discussion as an

01:12:02.522 --> 01:12:05.458
agenda item. Do so will allow
this community to have a sense

01:12:06.359 --> 01:12:09.194
of security and peace of mind
during these trying times. Thank

01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:12.164
you for your time and
consideration. Thank you for

01:12:12.532 --> 01:12:15.200
your comment. Next speaker,
please. I have an additional

01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:21.673
speaker card. Juana ramos.

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:24.430
Hello. Good afternoon, everyone.

01:12:24.144 --> 01:12:26.345
My name is juan ramos. I'm a
peer organizer with the

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280
coalition on homelessness. Um,

01:12:29.683 --> 01:12:31.683
same with everybody said,

01:12:32.185 --> 01:12:35.870
echoing what they said. But in
my perspective, I want you guys

01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:37.924
each one of you guys to put
yourselves in their point of

01:12:39.393 --> 01:12:41.393
shoes. And imagine you guys were

01:12:43.764 --> 01:12:46.199
in an rv and then you guys have
to work 24 over seven or 9 to 5,

01:12:47.968 --> 01:12:50.237
and you guys can't afford to
move your cars. Then you guys

01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:52.237
get tickets, right? Those

01:12:52.272 --> 01:12:54.574
tickets get piled up. You guys
can't afford that. Boom, you

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.478
lose your car. Where do you go
if the shelters are all booked

01:12:59.346 --> 01:13:01.346
up? Do everything has been

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.830
booked up? Where do you go? So
we could prevent homelessness by

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:09.589
at least extending. That's the
least we're asking is an

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660
extension of time for until, you

01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:17.697
know, maybe permanent housing or
everybody has their different

01:13:18.499 --> 01:13:20.600
needs. But this is very
important. Maybe not for you,

01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:24.236
but for this community, it is.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.840
And I made sure today that I
came to advocate and speak up on

01:13:27.943 --> 01:13:30.611
behalf of those who cannot be
here. For example, like flo

01:13:31.379 --> 01:13:34.181
said, yamila is one of the
families who was always showing

01:13:35.383 --> 01:13:37.383
up. But due to her getting in an

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:39.852
accident with the sfmta or muni,

01:13:40.221 --> 01:13:42.221
therefore she cannot work. She

01:13:42.624 --> 01:13:45.158
cannot pay, pay certain bills or
pay rent. So again, anybody can

01:13:46.395 --> 01:13:48.395
end up homeless in a blink of an

01:13:49.131 --> 01:13:51.966
eye. Just try putting yourself
in their shoes and really think
about it. What would you guys

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.836
do? What would you guys go if
you guys were homeless and had

01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:58.806
nowhere else but your rv? So
thank you for your time, but

01:14:00.842 --> 01:14:03.109
please have a heart. And we
really request either an

01:14:04.213 --> 01:14:06.213
extension safe parking housing,

01:14:07.249 --> 01:14:09.249
but please work with us to work

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.186
with you to work with them. It
takes a community to literally

01:14:13.422 --> 01:14:15.422
take care of our whole city and

01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:18.592
community. So together where we
could be stronger, not divided.

01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:22.330
Thank you. Thank you for your
comment. Do we have any other

01:14:22.965 --> 01:14:25.800
speakers in the room for general
public comment today? One more.

01:14:36.345 --> 01:14:38.345
Okay. My name is chaya french

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:41.183
and I am a staff member at
senior and disability action and

01:14:43.119 --> 01:14:45.454
i just wanted to come up here,
come up here and speak in

01:14:45.555 --> 01:14:47.555
support of everyone who just

01:14:47.623 --> 01:14:49.623
spoke up about winston drive and

01:14:49.692 --> 01:14:52.260
buckingham way, seniors and
people with disabilities are

01:14:53.796 --> 01:14:55.796
more likely to have unstable

01:14:55.799 --> 01:14:58.467
housing and live in rvs and cars
, and that's because of lack of

01:14:58.468 --> 01:15:00.903
accessible housing, lack of
employment opportunities and the

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:04.673
reality of living with more
health, health issues and

01:15:05.675 --> 01:15:08.443
ableism and ageism. So this is
an issue that's really important

01:15:09.512 --> 01:15:12.447
to us, and I can't quite imagine
what could be more important

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.850
than people having a safe place

01:15:16.186 --> 01:15:18.186
to live to enforce this parking

01:15:19.122 --> 01:15:22.260
restrictions. I believe that we
as a city and we as a community,

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.294
we have a responsibility to
create a city where everyone can

01:15:26.496 --> 01:15:28.496
have housing that works for them

01:15:28.531 --> 01:15:30.531
and we're not there yet. And

01:15:31.468 --> 01:15:33.469
until we are, I don't think we
have any right to create rules

01:15:33.804 --> 01:15:35.804
that police the existence of

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.600
people who just need resources.

01:15:38.275 --> 01:15:40.275
I think at a minimum, the ask

01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:42.778
that people are making feels so
small to find a process that

01:15:44.614 --> 01:15:47.349
works for everyone to have the
housing that they need to have a

01:15:48.952 --> 01:15:51.421
place to park. And I think we
owe it to people to make that

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.230
process as humane and as many
minimally stressful as possible.

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.828
And for it to take however many
months it needs to take. Thank

01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:02.965
you. Thank you for your comment.
We have no other speakers in the

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:05.368
room. Could you please open
remote? Secretary silva at this

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:08.738
time we'll move to remote public
comment not to exceed a total

01:16:09.173 --> 01:16:11.173
time of ten minutes. Members of

01:16:13.264 --> 01:16:15.645
the public wishing to comment
should star three to enter the
queue. Each speaker will have
two minutes. Moderator first

01:16:18.749 --> 01:16:20.749
speaker hello. Good afternoon

01:16:21.352 --> 01:16:24.321
again. This is barry toronto. I
first want to point out, I meant

01:16:24.656 --> 01:16:26.924
to mention the director's report
that directors hamlin mentioned

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.660
NOVEMBER 27th. He said it's a

01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:34.300
tuesday. The 27th is a monday,
so you might want to correct

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600
that in the minutes because

01:16:37.902 --> 01:16:40.470
that's not the date. It's not a
tuesday. The next topic is it's

01:16:42.107 --> 01:16:44.441
now coming on to the holiday
season and heavy security around

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.100
union square started already.

01:16:48.179 --> 01:16:50.179
And it'd be great if to make

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.650
sure to know that the ada and
the transit first policy should

01:16:54.552 --> 01:16:56.552
allow taxis to use the transit

01:16:56.587 --> 01:16:59.457
lanes even though it's closed to
other traffic at night. It'd be

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.290
great if your your top people,
such as the chair and director

01:17:06.865 --> 01:17:09.266
tomlin, meet with the police
brass and make sure that word

01:17:10.202 --> 01:17:13.370
gets out to all the officers is
that that taxis are allowed to

01:17:13.638 --> 01:17:16.508
use the transit lanes even
through union square and we

01:17:18.344 --> 01:17:20.344
carry people who cannot get on a

01:17:21.313 --> 01:17:24.215
bus or cannot sit and wait for
an hour for a bus to show up at

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:26.349
night particularly. And it would

01:17:26.919 --> 01:17:28.919
be great if you if you made sure

01:17:28.954 --> 01:17:31.122
that we had access to the
transit lanes through union

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.460
square and also to make sure

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:40.130
that that we have clear cab

01:17:40.232 --> 01:17:43.101
stands in the union square area,
especially around the hotels and

01:17:44.269 --> 01:17:46.537
at macy's. So I appreciate that
you can help facilitate this.

01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:51.510
And make it happen sooner than
later. Thank you very much for

01:17:52.645 --> 01:17:54.645
your time. Thank you. Next

01:18:01.153 --> 01:18:03.254
speaker. Hello my name is rachel
clyde. I'm the west side

01:18:03.289 --> 01:18:05.423
community organizer with the san
francisco bicycle coalition. To

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.590
recap where we are in JANUARY of

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.896
this year, the lake merced
boulevard quick build was

01:18:11.465 --> 01:18:13.967
approved during the approval,
the mta pledged to delay

01:18:13.967 --> 01:18:15.967
implementation until supervisor

01:18:16.503 --> 01:18:18.503
melgar and hsh could find a safe

01:18:19.105 --> 01:18:20.606
relocation site for the rvs that
park along lake merced

01:18:21.307 --> 01:18:23.408
boulevard. We are very
supportive of this quick build

01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:26.345
project as it will provide vital
safety and access improvements

01:18:27.247 --> 01:18:29.348
and expand the bike network.
However, almost a year later,

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:32.183
there is still no safe parking

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:34.119
site and the mta has moved
forward with construction on

01:18:34.654 --> 01:18:37.389
lake merced boulevard, where
several rvs have already been

01:18:38.158 --> 01:18:40.325
towed as a result. Additionally
in mid SEPTEMBER, the board of

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:43.796
directors approved parking
restriction changes on two
adjacent streets winston and

01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:47.330
buckingham. That will displace
even more families living in rvs

01:18:48.736 --> 01:18:51.103
as the sf bicycle coalition. It
is our mission to transform san

01:18:51.338 --> 01:18:54.306
francisco's streets and
neighborhoods into safe just and

01:18:54.474 --> 01:18:56.742
livable places by promoting the
bicycle for everyday

01:18:57.811 --> 01:19:00.800
transportation, creating a new
bike lane by displacing dozens

01:19:00.548 --> 01:19:03.316
of families does not create the
just community. We are part of

01:19:04.218 --> 01:19:06.820
the end poverty coalition and
support the work this group has

01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:10.423
been doing to support the
families, students and seniors
living in their vehicles. We are

01:19:10.758 --> 01:19:13.459
disappointed by the board's
decision to move to approve and

01:19:13.627 --> 01:19:15.728
move forward with construction
on the lake. Merced quick build

01:19:16.997 --> 01:19:19.100
and the parking changes on
winston buckingham without

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.237
adequately supporting the
housing insecure individuals

01:19:21.769 --> 01:19:23.769
that live there. Transportation,

01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:26.406
safety and housing and security
are two of the largest issues

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.843
facing our city, and we will not
fix them by pitting the issues

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:32.579
against each other. We stand
with the end poverty coast

01:19:32.646 --> 01:19:34.646
coalition and the residents and

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.750
ask the mta board to delay the
parking restriction changes on

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.621
winston and buckingham. And we
demand that supervisor melgar

01:19:41.489 --> 01:19:44.424
and the board work urgently to
find a safe relocation site and

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.627
permanent housing for the people
who will soon be displaced.

01:19:47.762 --> 01:19:49.762
Thank you. Thank you. Next

01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:55.201
speaker. Hi, this is kristin

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.370
evans. I'm a small business

01:19:57.572 --> 01:19:59.572
owner and also also serve on the

01:20:00.408 --> 01:20:03.377
homeless oversight commission.
Um, I really do hope that we can

01:20:07.882 --> 01:20:10.830
work together as mta and. To
come up with a timeline that

01:20:10.219 --> 01:20:12.219
doesn't involve displacement

01:20:12.488 --> 01:20:14.488
before the individuals being

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.690
impacted are given appropriate

01:20:18.493 --> 01:20:20.493
offers. As the commission in our

01:20:21.163 --> 01:20:23.163
last update was that there had

01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:25.431
been outreach to about a quarter

01:20:26.501 --> 01:20:28.501
to a fifth of the residents that

01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:32.640
had been placed with appropriate
offers, and so that had left a

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:36.644
significt gap in the remaining
people that still needed to be

01:20:38.414 --> 01:20:40.415
given an appropriate offer. Um,
it's my understanding that

01:20:41.283 --> 01:20:43.283
there's plans for a safe sleep

01:20:43.919 --> 01:20:46.121
site or a safe parking site, but
we've not heard the details of

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.592
that or an opening date. So this
is really about cross

01:20:51.928 --> 01:20:54.896
departmental cooperation and
acting as one city and making

01:20:56.465 --> 01:20:58.566
sure that we are doing right by
the people that these new

01:20:58.934 --> 01:21:00.934
enforcement measures will

01:21:02.739 --> 01:21:05.674
displace. So I ask your
assistance in ensuring that we

01:21:06.643 --> 01:21:09.611
have a timeline that works for
both department sites and

01:21:12.699 --> 01:21:14.483
ensures that the people that are
currently on these two streets.

01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:16.884
Winston and buckingham, are

01:21:18.521 --> 01:21:20.521
given appropriate offers before

01:21:20.624 --> 01:21:22.624
enforcement begins. Thank you.

01:21:24.594 --> 01:21:26.594
Thank you. No additional callers

01:21:26.996 --> 01:21:28.996
. Okay we'll close public

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:32.734
comment for item nine. Uh,
colleagues, any further

01:21:35.505 --> 01:21:37.505
discussion on items raised today

01:21:37.674 --> 01:21:40.243
? Okay. I'll just. I'll just
state I and director tomlin had

01:21:40.277 --> 01:21:43.179
some correspondence about this.
We're firmly in support of cross

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.282
departmental coordination with.
That's why we brought emily

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:48.950
cohen to the previous hearing

01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:51.820
and modified our board action in
response to the guidance

01:21:52.656 --> 01:21:54.656
received and I have received a

01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:57.493
request from the coalition on

01:21:57.895 --> 01:21:59.895
property tours for a meeting and

01:22:00.464 --> 01:22:02.464
we have a meeting set with staff

01:22:02.566 --> 01:22:05.368
next monday to further continue
coordination discussion on this

01:22:05.369 --> 01:22:07.369
pressing issue of affordable

01:22:07.404 --> 01:22:09.205
housing in this city. Director
tomlin, is there anything you

01:22:10.807 --> 01:22:12.807
want to want to add or respond?

01:22:13.277 --> 01:22:15.277
And if not, we can move forward.

01:22:15.746 --> 01:22:18.448
I think we discussed at the last
meeting we want to do everything

01:22:18.515 --> 01:22:20.515
that we can to avoid towing

01:22:21.453 --> 01:22:23.486
vehicles and to also make sure
that we're respecting all san

01:22:25.256 --> 01:22:27.256
francisco residents and we look

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:29.959

collaboration with. All right.

Thank you, colleagues. Are there

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:45.730
any questions on the consent

01:24:46.566 --> 01:24:48.566
calendar from directors? I don't

01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:50.701
have a question, MADAM Chair,

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.739
but just a quick comment and you
don't. We do not need to

01:24:54.141 --> 01:24:57.760
separate this item and I will
move all the items after public

01:24:59.479 --> 01:25:01.479
comment. But just to comment

01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:03.848
quickly on the very last item on

01:25:04.217 --> 01:25:06.217
our consent calendar. 10.2 item

01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:10.890
I, uh, this is for the elm alley

01:25:10.858 --> 01:25:12.858
project and for the elm street

01:25:13.727 --> 01:25:15.727
closure. We did receive a packet

01:25:17.131 --> 01:25:20.660
of signatures in support from
some tenderloin community school

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:23.201
students on this. This is a

01:25:24.204 --> 01:25:26.940
closure for, for the recreation
area, for an additional

01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:29.475
recreation area. For them. This

01:25:31.478 --> 01:25:34.314
is a project that was allocated
funding in the tenderloin

01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:39.170
community action plan. Um as we

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.920
know, the, the tenderloin is the

01:25:43.324 --> 01:25:45.893
dense most we populated
neighborhood in the most densely

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.960
populated neighborhood in the

01:25:50.665 --> 01:25:52.665
city and also has the most

01:25:55.402 --> 01:25:57.637
children and also the least open
space in the city. We're trying

01:25:58.239 --> 01:26:00.440
to change that with a couple of
projects, including the golden

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.510
gate greenway and this project.

01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:07.790
So this will, um, the funding

01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.810
department is going to sort of

01:26:10.752 --> 01:26:12.752
co-design a play area upon

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.820
approval of this closure. So in

01:26:14.856 --> 01:26:16.856
full support of it and looking

01:26:17.292 --> 01:26:19.760
forward to, to seeing what they
do with it and inactivated

01:26:23.799 --> 01:26:26.267
street closure. Thank you for
raising that director agency.

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:29.236
Any other comments or questions
from board members on the

01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:33.306
consent calendar? Okay,

01:26:33.975 --> 01:26:36.244
colleagues, I did want to flag a
couple of the items that are

01:26:38.314 --> 01:26:40.314
street changes under 10.2 just

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.820
to make sure this board is aware

01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:45.820
of what we're being asked to
approve. So that's our items a,

01:26:49.424 --> 01:26:51.424
a and b, b also item are these

01:26:51.726 --> 01:26:53.726
are these are approvals for our

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.530
class two and class three

01:26:58.234 --> 01:27:00.702
bikeways as and the I find the
numbering scheme for bikeways to

01:27:00.869 --> 01:27:02.869
be very counter intuitive and

01:27:05.341 --> 01:27:07.341
confusing. We our class one is

01:27:07.342 --> 01:27:10.211
essentially a separated bike
trail. Class two is a painted

01:27:11.347 --> 01:27:13.782
bike lane, but no physical
protection class three is

01:27:14.917 --> 01:27:17.886
essentially a shared route where
you might have a sharrow in the

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.755
space, but cars and bikes
sharing the same space. Class

01:27:21.924 --> 01:27:24.626
four is a protected bike lane.
Someone should work on
renumbering that. So it makes

01:27:26.562 --> 01:27:28.898
more sense. But I just wanted to
flag for my colleagues that

01:27:29.132 --> 01:27:31.735
through the active communities
plan, we've been doing a lot of

01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:34.536
surveys of the types of
facilities that make people safe

01:27:36.106 --> 01:27:38.106
, feel safe riding in this city

01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:41.209
and no surprise, the data we
have received are exactly what

01:27:42.178 --> 01:27:45.115
you would think that people are
most comfortable in spaces like

01:27:45.115 --> 01:27:47.516
jfk promenade that are
completely car free and

01:27:47.884 --> 01:27:50.354
completely safe operated. And
then they are somewhat

01:27:50.354 --> 01:27:52.354
comfortable in physically

01:27:53.657 --> 01:27:55.758
protected spaces and most
people, from what I've seen,

01:27:57.127 --> 01:27:59.294
feel very, very uncomfortable
being asked to share the same

01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:02.630
space with a car or a class

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.680
three route. So I just wanted to

01:28:06.236 --> 01:28:08.938
sort of ask, we have adopted a
goal for the active communities

01:28:08.939 --> 01:28:11.741
plan and for streets in the city
that that are our plan should be

01:28:12.342 --> 01:28:14.342
safe and intuitive for all

01:28:15.745 --> 01:28:17.346
users. So I just want to ask
staff, whoever is meant to

01:28:18.248 --> 01:28:20.248
respond to this sort of how do

01:28:20.453 --> 01:28:22.786
we think class two and class
three facilities sort of meet

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200
that standard of being safe and

01:28:25.422 --> 01:28:27.757
intuitive for all users? And I'm
just personally feeling somewhat

01:28:28.225 --> 01:28:30.226
uncomfortable continuing to
approve these types of

01:28:32.596 --> 01:28:34.563
facilities. Good afternoon.
Ricardo lee, city traffic

01:28:35.599 --> 01:28:37.700
engineer. So the items before
you are part of the treasure

01:28:38.803 --> 01:28:40.803
island planning process in which

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.940
various cities departments have
participated, including to sfcta

01:28:46.744 --> 01:28:49.512
caltrans mta, public works. This
has been part of a very long

01:28:50.114 --> 01:28:52.281
process, a process that is
common to other new development

01:28:54.452 --> 01:28:56.452
areas. As I do want to assure

01:28:56.821 --> 01:28:59.220
the board that when we as staff
are at meetings discussing new

01:28:59.624 --> 01:29:02.559
streets, that we are taking the
feedback that we're learning

01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:05.280
over time about bicycle
facilities, pedestrian

01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:08.765
facilities, vision zero. And we
are taking those lessons into

01:29:09.667 --> 01:29:11.667
new street design as much as

01:29:12.337 --> 01:29:14.337
possible. So the facilities that

01:29:14.706 --> 01:29:17.441
are in treasure island
specifically that are related to

01:29:18.543 --> 01:29:20.543
getting in and out of the area,

01:29:22.627 --> 01:29:25.482
are protected. They are not
adjacent to parking. They would

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500
be considered type four

01:29:28.619 --> 01:29:30.855
facilities, bike paths or type
two facilities without parking

01:29:31.957 --> 01:29:34.825
adjacent to them. So the goal
there is that if you are on a

01:29:34.826 --> 01:29:37.728
main street or approaching
treasure island, that you would

01:29:38.263 --> 01:29:40.263
not be also trying to juggle

01:29:41.466 --> 01:29:43.467
adjacent park vehicles. There
are, of course, multiple

01:29:43.835 --> 01:29:46.603
considerations that go into
street design, emergency

01:29:49.542 --> 01:29:51.642
response and the space available
. There's a lot of space

01:29:51.877 --> 01:29:53.877
constraints, the developable

01:29:53.946 --> 01:29:55.946
land. Sometimes some facilities

01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:58.315
take up more land than others

01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:01.170
and so we do need to be mindful

01:30:01.153 --> 01:30:03.153
of those kind of needs in

01:30:03.688 --> 01:30:05.991
certain situations where the
streets are calm street, a local

01:30:08.227 --> 01:30:10.227
street, perhaps it MAY not have

01:30:10.396 --> 01:30:12.597
a class four facility, but but
it MAY have other types of

01:30:12.865 --> 01:30:14.865
bicycle facilities to facilitate

01:30:16.335 --> 01:30:19.270
safe travel based on it being
more of a local street, a slow

01:30:20.205 --> 01:30:22.740
street. So every everything that
we learn gets incorporated into

01:30:22.809 --> 01:30:24.809
designs. Unfortunately, the

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:28.146
designs are part of a long
process that MAY have started

01:30:28.915 --> 01:30:30.915
ten years ago. MAY have already

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720
been approved. But we do go, as

01:30:37.623 --> 01:30:39.623
advocates of vision zero and

01:30:41.695 --> 01:30:43.696
livability, we making sure that
there is adequate bicycle

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:46.765
facilities, but as well making
sure that the streets are calm,

01:30:47.767 --> 01:30:49.767
as narrow as they can be, that

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.437
they're safe intersections. All
those kind of considerations go

01:30:53.973 --> 01:30:55.973
into it and there are, like I

01:30:56.576 --> 01:30:59.479
said, guidance that goes into
it. Multiple departments get the

01:30:59.513 --> 01:31:01.380
comment, including the fire
department on how wide streets

01:31:03.383 --> 01:31:06.840
can be. And those are all issues
that the city has kind of

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:09.488
grappled with in the past. But I
think we're at this point at a

01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:13.125
at a point in which we are all
kind of aligned in terms of

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:15.259
these these street designs. So

01:31:15.496 --> 01:31:17.496
that's kind of at a broad level.

01:31:17.898 --> 01:31:20.733
You know, the board, I think,
directs us to kind of implement

01:31:21.668 --> 01:31:23.770
these these street changes. But
on these kind of processes,

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:26.706
we're working as a city,
creating a brand new city, brand

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:29.441
new street grids and we're

01:31:29.676 --> 01:31:32.545
trying to do as best as we can
to create new streets that don't

01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:36.150
have the issues of our old
streets. We certainly don't want

01:31:36.517 --> 01:31:38.517
to have those kind of problems.

01:31:41.322 --> 01:31:43.823
So okay, I think we MAY be
approaching the sever threshold.

01:31:46.226 --> 01:31:49.128
I'm looking at the city attorney
. What do you think? If we want

01:31:49.264 --> 01:31:51.264
to have more discussion on this

01:31:51.733 --> 01:31:54.668
topic or can we just go on?
Yeah, if you'd like to have more

01:31:54.902 --> 01:31:57.300
discussion on, I would recommend
you sever it. If you're

01:31:58.172 --> 01:32:00.172
satisfied with staff's response,

01:32:02.309 --> 01:32:04.477
you can just move forward with,
okay, I think I'm going to go

01:32:05.813 --> 01:32:07.813
ahead and sever sever b and r

01:32:07.916 --> 01:32:10.450
and then we can move ahead with
the consent calendar. So we'll
take public comment separately

01:32:11.352 --> 01:32:13.352
on those pieces. Director

01:32:15.723 --> 01:32:18.592
hemminger well, if we're going
to sever the items, I'll wait to

01:32:19.727 --> 01:32:21.727
talk on the severed items. Okay,

01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:24.630
great. So let's, let's move

01:32:24.733 --> 01:32:26.733
forward to public comment on the

01:32:27.969 --> 01:32:29.969
consent calendar. Less a, b, b,

01:32:30.539 --> 01:32:32.506
and item r of 10.2, please. Are
there any public comments on

01:32:33.742 --> 01:32:35.742
that section of the consent

01:32:39.847 --> 01:32:41.847
calendar. Secretary silva can I

01:32:53.228 --> 01:32:55.228
present them? Sure.

01:32:55.997 --> 01:32:57.997
I board members. Luke bornheimer

01:33:00.336 --> 01:33:02.336
I would encourage you to sever

01:33:03.239 --> 01:33:05.239
item 10.2 to be, which is about

01:33:05.274 --> 01:33:08.209
bayshore boulevard. So I wanted
to bring this up so you can see

01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:11.379
this. I ride this section of
bayshore many times with my

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.780
child and witnessed many other

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.820
people riding it. So 10.2 be

01:33:18.187 --> 01:33:20.187
currently creates a class four

01:33:20.823 --> 01:33:22.991
bikeway, which is a great thing.
We should have more class four

01:33:23.292 --> 01:33:25.260
bikeways in the city. We should
really only be building those in

01:33:25.394 --> 01:33:28.263
the city. Unfortunately, it's
only northbound. So if you look

01:33:29.498 --> 01:33:31.498
here and actually if I if I zoom

01:33:31.667 --> 01:33:33.667
in, you will see that the

01:33:33.836 --> 01:33:36.305
southbound a bike route on this
section is actually on the

01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:39.730
sidewalk, which includes a fire

01:33:39.542 --> 01:33:42.377
hydrant. And a pole in the
middle of the sidewalk. If
you're riding a family cargo

01:33:43.313 --> 01:33:45.313
bike, you can't ride on that

01:33:45.915 --> 01:33:48.784
sidewalk. So I like 99% of
people who ride a bike

01:33:49.985 --> 01:33:51.985
southbound through the section

01:33:52.288 --> 01:33:54.288
right in the right turn lane on

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580
an eight lane, one way road that

01:33:57.127 --> 01:33:59.127
is a highway off ramp and a

01:33:59.262 --> 01:34:02.130
highway on ramp. This is every
day reality of riding a bike for

01:34:02.131 --> 01:34:04.131
everyday transportation in san

01:34:05.234 --> 01:34:08.169
francisco, people will ride
southbound in that northbound

01:34:09.139 --> 01:34:11.139
bikeway. It should be designed

01:34:11.842 --> 01:34:13.842
and built as a two way bikeway.

01:34:13.944 --> 01:34:16.579
I don't quite care about space
constraints or the fire

01:34:17.414 --> 01:34:19.414
department or whoever else gets

01:34:19.549 --> 01:34:22.251
input. People are using that
right turn lane as a two way

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:25.420
bikeway right now. We should

01:34:25.755 --> 01:34:27.791
build and design on our bike
infrastructure to match how

01:34:28.527 --> 01:34:31.270
people are actually using our
bike infrastructure in the city.

01:34:32.463 --> 01:34:34.463
So I appreciate staff's work on

01:34:34.731 --> 01:34:36.731
it. I have talked to public

01:34:36.767 --> 01:34:38.968
works about this and mta staff
about this in the past and I

01:34:41.872 --> 01:34:44.440
just encourage you to sever that
item and for staff to create a

01:34:44.808 --> 01:34:46.808
two way bikeway design, install

01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:49.212
it as soon as possible and
ideally with concrete. Because

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.882
again, this is a highway off
ramp and a highway on ramp where

01:34:53.217 --> 01:34:55.885
someone walking was killed not
less than three months ago.

01:34:57.588 --> 01:34:59.588
Thank you. Thank you. Are there

01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:02.191
other comments on the consent
calendar last the currently

01:35:08.766 --> 01:35:11.567
severed items. My name is scott
brockman and I'm here in support

01:35:13.137 --> 01:35:15.872
of consent calendar item 10.2. I
I have been advocating for this

01:35:16.573 --> 01:35:18.875
limited street closure of elm
street for almost four years. It

01:35:20.578 --> 01:35:22.780
struck me as a simple way to
create more outdoor space and

01:35:22.814 --> 01:35:24.814
increase street safety in the

01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:27.885
tenderloin. But even in the
first year of the pandemic, when

01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:31.121
so much effort was put into
creating ways for people to get

01:35:31.322 --> 01:35:33.322
outside safely in other parts of

01:35:33.891 --> 01:35:35.692
the city, it turned out to be
impossible to close this one

01:35:36.628 --> 01:35:39.230
block of a small alley, not
impossible to do, just

01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:42.532
impossible to get done. It was

01:35:42.834 --> 01:35:44.968
not until the community demands
that resulted in the tenderloin

01:35:45.303 --> 01:35:47.605
community action plan and strong
support for it in the

01:35:47.605 --> 01:35:49.907
participated three budgeting
process that the simple project

01:35:52.877 --> 01:35:54.877
gained traction of course, it is

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:57.216
odd that it's taken so long. A
few years back, the national

01:35:57.216 --> 01:35:59.830
association of city
transportation officials

01:35:59.751 --> 01:36:01.751
proposed such closures adjacent

01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:04.220
to schools as part of a pandemic

01:36:04.489 --> 01:36:06.457
response and recovery strategies
. Their estimated timeline for

01:36:07.459 --> 01:36:10.327
one of these school streets was
as days or weeks to plan and

01:36:11.597 --> 01:36:14.566
hours to implement it. But here
we are today. I hope you'll

01:36:15.234 --> 01:36:17.234
agree that reimagining how elm

01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:20.639
street can be used is the right
thing for the neighborhood. And
specifically the 300 children

01:36:20.639 --> 01:36:23.374
who attend tenderloin community
school. Thank you. Thank you for

01:36:24.977 --> 01:36:26.977
your comment. Any other speakers

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.622
in the room. Good afternoon,
commissioners. I would like to

01:36:40.292 --> 01:36:42.292
request to pull item 10.2 a off

01:36:43.228 --> 01:36:45.830
of a consent calendar. It was an
informational item that was

01:36:47.133 --> 01:36:49.133
discussed on the OCTOBER 17th

01:36:49.869 --> 01:36:52.272
and I was told that we can pull
it off consent for further

01:36:52.272 --> 01:36:54.272
discussion and public comment.

01:36:58.210 --> 01:37:00.210
Appreciate it. Okay. Any other

01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:04.490
commenters in the room seeing
none, please open a remote at

01:37:06.219 --> 01:37:09.188
this time. We'll move to remote
public comment not to exceed a

01:37:09.856 --> 01:37:11.891
total time of ten minutes.
Members of the public wishing to

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:14.590
comment should star three to
enter the queue. Each speaker

01:37:17.563 --> 01:37:20.532
will have two minutes. Moderator
first speaker oh, excuse me. I

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:25.270
meant to speak to the delay to

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:29.541
extend the parking meters and

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.643
not do this during the holidays,

01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:34.246
so I'm sorry, my hand was still
up, but I was next to speak.

01:37:35.448 --> 01:37:37.448
Thank you very much. Please

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.886
think of the folks. Bye bye.

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.756
Thank you. Next speaker. Hello.

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:48.561
Good afternoon again. This is
barry toronto. I want to point

01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:52.898
out that most of the items in do
not go through engineering.

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.135
Hearing the bimonthly
engineering hearings that are

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.538
held on friday mornings. So I'm

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:02.208
concerned that these items were
not vetted properly with the

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:06.179
public before they appeared on
the on the consent calendar. I'm

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.881
very disturbed by that,
especially the ones involving

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.500
marin street and cesar chavez

01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:15.188
and kansas. Those did not get
through a proper vetting through

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:17.356
a public hearing. Second,

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:19.892
regarding the treasure island, I

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.863
cannot comment on any of those
changes because I go to treasure

01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:25.664
island with passengers or pick

01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:28.901
up maybe once every two months.

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:31.771
So I'm not able to accept that.
I think I hope you vetted it

01:38:32.107 --> 01:38:35.900
properly and proper outreach
with the people who already live

01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:38.645
there at treasure island. If
not, you should you should at

01:38:39.547 --> 01:38:41.547
least ask staff to provide

01:38:41.549 --> 01:38:43.549
proper feedback on what a proper

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.887
what the feedback was from from
the outreach meetings, if you

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:52.258
held any and last but not least,

01:38:55.730 --> 01:38:57.730
is the let's see the here is

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.267
that the I'm concerned about the

01:39:03.238 --> 01:39:05.439
stop sign putting on potrero
excuse me on connecticut at 26th

01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:09.109
street. It's an uphill a very

01:39:09.244 --> 01:39:11.244
steep hill. And I'm not exactly

01:39:11.513 --> 01:39:14.348
sure that forcing a bus to stop
at a stop sign there going up or

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:16.616
down the hill would be efficient

01:39:17.119 --> 01:39:19.119
or would would be meet the

01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:22.489
safety purposes necessary. So
question putting a stop sign

01:39:24.493 --> 01:39:27.128
there at on on connecticut at
26th street. Thank you very

01:39:31.767 --> 01:39:33.767
much. Thank you. Next speaker.

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:37.170
Hi my name is michael howley.

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.140
I'm calling to also request that

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.760
you sever item 10.2. Be that

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.915
area of bayshore is a really
confusing and frankly terrifying

01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:49.517
place to bike through,
especially if you've just

01:39:51.253 --> 01:39:53.454
emerged from the hairball, which
is better than it used to be,

01:39:54.223 --> 01:39:57.910
but still very confused and not
very pleasant on a bike. And the

01:39:57.226 --> 01:39:59.226
bike route, as is, dumps you

01:39:59.396 --> 01:40:01.396
into oncoming high speed truck

01:40:02.498 --> 01:40:04.934
traffic. So I think this item
should be separate and as

01:40:04.934 --> 01:40:06.934
previous commenters stated,

01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:09.536
discussed as a two way protected

01:40:09.806 --> 01:40:12.407
bike lane to connect to the
southeast corner of the city,

01:40:13.743 --> 01:40:16.611
which is extremely neglected in
a lot of ways, not not least of

01:40:18.315 --> 01:40:20.315
which is how difficult it is to

01:40:21.184 --> 01:40:23.585
get in or out of that area on
foot or by bike. Thank you.

01:40:28.124 --> 01:40:30.124
Thank you. No additional

01:40:31.894 --> 01:40:33.729
speakers. Okay. So we've
received through public comment

01:40:35.666 --> 01:40:37.666
two additional requests. So we

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:41.770
will sever 10.2 a and b, but

01:40:42.439 --> 01:40:44.607
I'll go ahead and do a vote
first on the consent calendar

01:40:47.711 --> 01:40:50.579
minus 10.2 a, b, r, a and b, b.
Is there a motion from the board

01:40:51.782 --> 01:40:53.782
on the majority of the consent

01:40:53.984 --> 01:40:56.619
calendar? First, so moved on the
balance. Okay, great. Please

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.890
call the roll on the motion to
approve the consent calendar

01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:02.358
with those noted items removed.
Director hemminger a hemminger.

01:41:02.793 --> 01:41:05.561
Director henderson. Hi
henderson. I director hinsey. Hi

01:41:07.164 --> 01:41:09.164
kinsey. I director. So I. So I

01:41:09.433 --> 01:41:11.433
director kahina. Hi kahina chair

01:41:12.336 --> 01:41:14.336
ekin ekin. I thank you. The

01:41:14.639 --> 01:41:16.639
consent calendar is approved.

01:41:17.374 --> 01:41:19.374
Okay, so we'll just go in order.

01:41:20.244 --> 01:41:22.345
I'll take now ten point 2aa the
class four bikeway on church

01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:26.415
street. It is there any
discussion from the board on

01:41:28.119 --> 01:41:30.119
this item? And if not, we'll

01:41:30.455 --> 01:41:32.455
open it to public comment for

01:41:32.523 --> 01:41:34.523
anyone in the room on 10.2 a the

01:41:37.261 --> 01:41:39.261
church street class four bikeway

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400
.

01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:47.670
Hey board members. Luke

01:41:47.739 --> 01:41:49.907
bornheimer I didn't really
prepare for this one as much,

01:41:50.775 --> 01:41:52.609
but I ride through this area
quite often. I appreciate

01:41:53.611 --> 01:41:56.580
staff's work on it. I think that
this area would be a great

01:41:57.315 --> 01:42:00.216
opportunity and MAY be out of
scope for this project right now

01:42:01.186 --> 01:42:03.186
. But to create a full sidewalk

01:42:03.388 --> 01:42:05.388
level pedestrian plaza that also

01:42:06.825 --> 01:42:08.825
has a sidewalk level bike lane,

01:42:09.194 --> 01:42:11.929
the project team has been doing
a great job to make the best of

01:42:12.630 --> 01:42:14.798
what they have with the
materials that they have access

01:42:15.266 --> 01:42:17.535
to. But I think there's a really
great opportunity to make that

01:42:17.535 --> 01:42:20.371
section of church street a
really great space as a transit

01:42:21.730 --> 01:42:23.375
plaza. Tons of people walking
there, tons of people biking

01:42:23.375 --> 01:42:25.376
there, tons of people taking
transit there, and a bunch of

01:42:25.944 --> 01:42:28.379
businesses that would benefit
from a really robust pedestrian

01:42:29.748 --> 01:42:32.183
plaza that just has muni going
through it. And this is

01:42:33.552 --> 01:42:35.552
unrelated to the bikeway. But I

01:42:35.954 --> 01:42:38.324
will point out that the transit
only lane on church street

01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:40.324
between market and 15th is

01:42:43.429 --> 01:42:45.696
regularly ridden through by cars
regularly like 1 to 2 per light.

01:42:47.499 --> 01:42:49.499
So something to make that stop

01:42:49.701 --> 01:42:51.701
would be great. Thank you. Thank

01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:06.450
you. Other speakers on 10.2 a.

01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.580
At least have theead. Good

01:43:15.995 --> 01:43:17.995
afternoon again, commissioners.

01:43:20.767 --> 01:43:22.767
Ty bash. Recently this board has

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.637
voted to disallow a right turn
from market street onto church

01:43:25.671 --> 01:43:27.671
street for commercial vehicles

01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:32.610
that will be oops, I have this

01:43:33.379 --> 01:43:35.379
thing upside down, this turn

01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:37.381
right over here. The

01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:40.486
justification was a conflict
between pedestrian boarding the

01:43:41.688 --> 01:43:43.688
southbound church and busses and

01:43:44.991 --> 01:43:46.991
commercial traffic actually,

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.260
this conflict was identified to

01:43:49.329 --> 01:43:51.597
be so severe that in 2020,
making a left turn onto church

01:43:53.433 --> 01:43:55.433
from market as well as crossing

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.300
market street from the north for
non commercial vehicles was

01:43:59.539 --> 01:44:01.539
outlawed. So today going down on

01:44:01.574 --> 01:44:03.574
church street there's really

01:44:03.744 --> 01:44:05.744
only one way to go is driving

01:44:08.181 --> 01:44:11.150
south on church street which is
a street that actually dead ends

01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:13.151
a block away. It's very

01:44:13.554 --> 01:44:15.922
difficult to navigate at this
intersection going down on

01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:20.260
church now, on the flip side,
sfmta is looking to implement a

01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:25.665
class four bicycle of south
bound bike lane on the block,

01:44:26.801 --> 01:44:29.402
which crosses the path of travel
for muni riders and is just

01:44:32.273 --> 01:44:34.273
inches away from sfmta platform.

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:36.375
That is going to be and is being

01:44:37.111 --> 01:44:39.513
claimed to be heavily used by by
muni riders. Let me bring that

01:44:48.356 --> 01:44:50.356
up.

01:44:51.625 --> 01:44:53.625
during the OCTOBER 17th meeting,

01:44:54.128 --> 01:44:56.930
MR. Rhodes shared with you the
plans and stated church street

01:44:57.699 --> 01:44:59.699
is not a designated bike route,

01:45:00.402 --> 01:45:02.402
so why are we designating a

01:45:02.404 --> 01:45:04.571
class four raised bike lane
where human powered and electric

01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:08.441
bikes and scooters traveling up

01:45:08.509 --> 01:45:10.509
to 25mph, just inches away from

01:45:11.245 --> 01:45:13.245
unassuming muni riders waiting

01:45:13.482 --> 01:45:15.482
for the j church in the 22 bus

01:45:15.817 --> 01:45:18.218
or inches away from the proposed
public plaza and dining space.

01:45:20.622 --> 01:45:23.224
Okay that's ime. Thank
you. This makes absolutely no

01:45:23.325 --> 01:45:25.325
sense. Thank you for your

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560
comment. Are there any other

01:45:29.364 --> 01:45:31.398
speakers on 10.2 a in the room?
Seeing none, please open a

01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:36.270
remote at this time we'll move
to remote public comment not to

01:45:36.505 --> 01:45:38.506
exceed a total time of ten
minutes. Members of the public

01:45:39.474 --> 01:45:41.474
wishing to comment on this item.

01:45:41.943 --> 01:45:43.844
10.2 a should dial star three to
enter the queue. Each speaker

01:45:44.446 --> 01:45:46.446
will have two minutes. No

01:45:47.816 --> 01:45:49.816
speakers. Okay close public

01:45:51.854 --> 01:45:53.854
comment. Is there a motion on on

01:45:59.228 --> 01:46:01.228
10.2 a. I will move the item. Is

01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:03.930
there a second? I'll second.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:06.333
Please call the roll on the

01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:08.203
motion to approve item 10.2. A
director heminger heminger

01:46:08.871 --> 01:46:10.871
director henderson. Henderson.

01:46:12.942 --> 01:46:14.942
Director kinsey a kinsey I

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.780
director. So I. So I director

01:46:18.881 --> 01:46:21.820
kahina a kahina ekin I icon. I
thank you. That item is approved

01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:25.870
moving on to item 10.2 b. Got it
. Okay. Public comment for

01:46:26.122 --> 01:46:28.122
anyone in the room on 10.2 b

01:46:29.859 --> 01:46:32.661
this is to establish a class for
bikeway. This is bayshore
boulevard, class four bikeway on

01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:35.629
bayshore for that. One speaker

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
has already commented on. Okay.

01:46:41.939 --> 01:46:43.939
Seeing no speakers in the room

01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.448
on this. One yes. Sorry deputy
city attorney susan

01:46:52.982 --> 01:46:54.982
cleveland-knowles. I think in

01:46:55.318 --> 01:46:58.530
the future going forward, when
someone asks to sever an item

01:46:59.656 --> 01:47:01.591
that should be the end of their
public comment and then they

01:47:02.326 --> 01:47:04.326
would get public comment at this

01:47:04.361 --> 01:47:06.495
opportunity because that didn't
happen today and we didn't

01:47:07.197 --> 01:47:09.298
notify the speaker. I would
suggest giving him additional

01:47:10.834 --> 01:47:12.834
time today. But going forward,

01:47:12.902 --> 01:47:15.700
it would be better to group the
substantive public comment at

01:47:15.672 --> 01:47:18.700
the time. The item is heard.
Thank you for clarifying. Go

01:47:21.879 --> 01:47:24.113
ahead. Thank you so much. I'll
keep this very short. Luke

01:47:25.184 --> 01:47:28.500
bornheimer, the one additional
thing I would add is that as the

01:47:28.218 --> 01:47:30.419
other caller mentioned, you're
coming out of the hairball when

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.820
you're coming southbound because

01:47:33.230 --> 01:47:35.792
of the curb cut, you are
actually then forced to ride

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.164
east toward the oncoming cars to
then come back out into the

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.102
street and people are crossing
each other very closely on

01:47:46.937 --> 01:47:48.937
bikes. And it ends up being

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.142
conflicts there as well. So it'd
be great to see actually that

01:47:53.144 --> 01:47:56.460
sidewalk and crossing be
upgraded so that it's either
just a raised crossing to this

01:47:58.182 --> 01:48:00.350
bikeway or just cut a new ramp
that allows people to come off

01:48:01.219 --> 01:48:03.219
the ramp and not have to ride

01:48:03.254 --> 01:48:06.220
directly into car traffic. Sorry
if I'm not preventing a good

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.258
visual. Thank you. Thank you.
Any other speakers in the room

01:48:09.161 --> 01:48:11.161
on 10.2? Be if none, please go

01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:13.263
to remote at this time we'll
move to remote public comment

01:48:14.799 --> 01:48:16.433
not to exceed a total time. Ten
minutes. Members of the public

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.536
wishing to comment on item 10.2
be should dial star three to

01:48:19.537 --> 01:48:21.537
enter the queue. Each speaker

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.474
will have two minutes. No
speakers. Okay, we'll close

01:48:25.142 --> 01:48:27.142
public comment. Directors

01:48:28.113 --> 01:48:30.547
director hemminger please. Maybe
first if I could ask lou, could

01:48:31.316 --> 01:48:33.316
you put your graphic back up? I

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.554
think be helpful for all of us
to see something visual and I

01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:39.189
had a question for the city

01:48:39.257 --> 01:48:41.257
traffic engineer. Are city

01:48:41.459 --> 01:48:44.610
engineer, whether you're
familiar with this location and

01:48:45.970 --> 01:48:47.970
whether you're satisfied with

01:48:58.110 --> 01:49:00.110
what we've come up with.

01:49:00.212 --> 01:49:02.212
Ricardo city traffic engineer I

01:49:04.583 --> 01:49:06.583
will present talia leong, who's

01:49:06.852 --> 01:49:09.487
the project manager for the
hairball project, so she can
answer questions about the

01:49:09.855 --> 01:49:11.855
details of this project.

01:49:13.993 --> 01:49:15.993
Obviously I'm not satisfied with

01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:19.231
the condition like it's a
situation that we've, we've

01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:22.267
struggled in the past to
address. But I'll defer to staff

01:49:23.136 --> 01:49:25.136
on, on the details of the

01:49:25.538 --> 01:49:27.806
project. I do want to clarify
that there was a statement made

01:49:29.175 --> 01:49:31.109
that the this item had not had a
public hearing on a friday. This

01:49:32.144 --> 01:49:35.800
is the public hearing for this
item. And that was in the agenda

01:49:36.249 --> 01:49:38.417
as a as a hearing that was
posted for the board to hear

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.390
this item. Thank you. Just give
me a minute while I pull some

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.860
grp that might help. And

01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:52.930
director henderson, is your hand

01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:55.650
raised on 10.2 be as well? Yes.

01:50:13.587 --> 01:50:15.788
Okay great. Okay.
Okay. Just to explain the item a

01:50:16.523 --> 01:50:18.691
little bit, because I know it's
a little bit confusing. We've

01:50:19.993 --> 01:50:22.595
been working on improving what's
in the hairball for a while now

01:50:23.697 --> 01:50:26.332
as we can and looking at what's
actually feasible out there

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.400
given how complicated the

01:50:29.837 --> 01:50:31.837
hairball area is where cesar

01:50:32.106 --> 01:50:34.106
chavez, potrero and bayshore all

01:50:34.308 --> 01:50:36.308
come together underneath the 101

01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:38.610
overpass. So it's a very just a

01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:41.914
lot of utilities, etcetera, a
lot of conflict areas. And it's

01:50:43.117 --> 01:50:45.551
also a really important area
where pedestrians and bikes

01:50:47.588 --> 01:50:50.900
cross from the east side to the
west side, from the bayshore

01:50:50.658 --> 01:50:53.426
into the mission, into downtown
and vice versa. So it's a really

01:50:53.494 --> 01:50:55.862
important place to make these
improvements and we're doing

01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:58.830
everything that we can given the

01:51:00.234 --> 01:51:02.234
resources that we have and we're

01:51:02.703 --> 01:51:04.703
starting with some of the things

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.274
that you see here and that are
on the consent calendar. And

01:51:08.343 --> 01:51:11.311
they include, you know, paint
and post improve joints and some

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.460
concrete that's protecting those

01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:17.417
bike lanes. So I will also mark
will go into some details in

01:51:18.653 --> 01:51:21.354
just a second in terms of that
portion of bike lane that luke

01:51:24.626 --> 01:51:26.626
brought up. But those the class

01:51:26.795 --> 01:51:28.795
four bikeways that are proposed

01:51:29.164 --> 01:51:31.765
are protected by concrete rail.
So they are protected by

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.237
concrete from traffic. This is
this is the beginning of what

01:51:37.705 --> 01:51:39.907
we're trying to do here. We are
also working with public works

01:51:42.544 --> 01:51:45.313
on a long term plan for this
area to do more concrete

01:51:45.981 --> 01:51:48.616
changes. But those just require
a lot of detailed design and

01:51:49.618 --> 01:51:51.618
coordination with public works

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:54.321
and utilities to be able to do
even the smallest things here

01:51:54.522 --> 01:51:56.522
because of how complicated this

01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.728
area is. So I just want to note
that we have been looking at

01:52:00.729 --> 01:52:02.931
this at a high level for a while
and looking at everything that

01:52:03.332 --> 01:52:05.332
we can possibly do to make it a

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:08.340
little bit better and safer. So

01:52:08.574 --> 01:52:11.405
I will this is the list in just
sort of layperson language of

01:52:11.506 --> 01:52:13.506
all the things that are

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:15.810
happening as part of what you

01:52:16.212 --> 01:52:18.212
see in the agenda. But we also

01:52:18.614 --> 01:52:21.149
have some drawings that explain
that particular area that luke

01:52:21.917 --> 01:52:23.917
brought up. So I will pull that

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.220
up and then mark can talk to the

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.620
class four bikeway section.

01:52:35.365 --> 01:52:37.365
Three yeah. Can we? You know, I

01:52:37.433 --> 01:52:40.102
hate to say it, but the, the
photograph is a lot more

01:52:47.143 --> 01:52:49.143
instructive. An interesting

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.580
right. I can never read a plan.

01:52:52.716 --> 01:52:54.716
I mean there's while they're

01:52:55.118 --> 01:52:57.453
working to bring up the detail
let me speak to this from a

01:52:58.321 --> 01:53:00.321
larger policy perspective. This

01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:03.558
board has previously directed
staff to move quickly, including

01:53:05.863 --> 01:53:08.831
in light of the loss of 40% of
our capital budget. As a result

01:53:09.666 --> 01:53:11.666
of the loss of prop eight two

01:53:11.768 --> 01:53:14.370
years ago. We found this to be a
really successful strategy in

01:53:14.504 --> 01:53:16.504
order to help us leverage

01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:18.740
outside capital money by working

01:53:20.677 --> 01:53:22.677
incrementally and quickly in

01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:24.879
order to move towards the ideal

01:53:26.884 --> 01:53:28.884
solution with many quick low

01:53:30.787 --> 01:53:33.756
cost steps along the way, we
still like what's out there
right now is completely

01:53:34.658 --> 01:53:36.658
unacceptable. The design

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.160
proposed by staff is far from

01:53:39.462 --> 01:53:41.462
perfect, but but we believe it

01:53:42.133 --> 01:53:44.701
helps us advance our goal, which
would otherwise be impossible

01:53:47.838 --> 01:53:50.773
given our capital constraints.
Hi everyone. Jeff but the

01:53:51.542 --> 01:53:53.542
testimony we're getting and if

01:53:53.811 --> 01:53:55.811
it's accurate that what users

01:53:56.346 --> 01:53:58.346
are actually doing with the

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.500
current design is doing a wrong

01:54:02.954 --> 01:54:04.954
way, I mean, don't we have to

01:54:04.956 --> 01:54:07.570
find some way to frustrate that?
So that that's not what's

01:54:07.625 --> 01:54:09.625
occurring out there? Yeah. So

01:54:09.694 --> 01:54:11.996
the I mean, I'm familiar with
this area as well and that's

01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:14.730
exactly how I bike through it.

01:54:15.232 --> 01:54:17.232
And again, I would love to

01:54:18.436 --> 01:54:20.704
provide an actual path solution
on. We just don't have the means

01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:24.741
to build that right now. Again,
could I just have the photograph

01:54:27.612 --> 01:54:29.680
back? You know, these dueling
graphics really don't help the

01:54:33.318 --> 01:54:35.318
cause because I thought the

01:54:35.687 --> 01:54:37.688
point that luke was making was,
is there something on the

01:54:38.423 --> 01:54:40.291
sidewalk we could do? Could we
take that plug out of there?

01:54:41.159 --> 01:54:43.159
Could we get the sign out of

01:54:44.329 --> 01:54:46.731
there? Yeah yes. And those are
those are exactly the solutions

01:54:46.731 --> 01:54:48.731
that we're trying to move

01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:51.330
towards. But again, removing

01:54:51.136 --> 01:54:53.838
that fire hydrant is far more
expensive than we have the

01:54:55.107 --> 01:54:57.107
resources to do and would take

01:54:57.476 --> 01:54:59.476
years longer. So again, what

01:54:59.711 --> 01:55:02.480
we're trying to do is to do
something in order to put the
resources together and develop.

01:55:03.749 --> 01:55:05.749
We even know if it's an active

01:55:06.284 --> 01:55:09.187
plug, it's a it's a high painted
as and there's also pga or

01:55:12.191 --> 01:55:14.191
utility poles. Um, MAY I I'm

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.860
sorry to get out of whack here,

01:55:17.763 --> 01:55:19.763
but so, so along the chase

01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:23.000
center, you know, I think I
remember seeing bike lanes that

01:55:23.672 --> 01:55:25.672
go both directions. Is this a

01:55:25.905 --> 01:55:27.905
possibility we can implement

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:30.700
similar type of configurations.

01:55:30.376 --> 01:55:32.376
So then instead of encouraging

01:55:32.945 --> 01:55:34.945
only one directional traffic and

01:55:36.248 --> 01:55:38.950
then the other side needs to
have haphazardly, you know,

01:55:41.854 --> 01:55:43.854
hovering over pga power pole and

01:55:43.857 --> 01:55:46.591
fire hydrants. So again, that's
exactly our goal for later. Once

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.329
we have resources. But in the
meantime, we're trying to move

01:55:51.698 --> 01:55:53.698
incrementally as quickly as we

01:55:55.935 --> 01:55:58.603
can afford to do so. So moving
moving towards that ideal

01:55:59.338 --> 01:56:01.338
solution would require that we

01:56:01.608 --> 01:56:03.608
cancel this project and come

01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:07.450
back to you at least a year from

01:56:07.147 --> 01:56:10.115
now as part of the active
communities plan process in

01:56:10.917 --> 01:56:12.917
order to move forward with

01:56:13.286 --> 01:56:16.255
anything and what we believe
again is that by moving quickly,

01:56:17.457 --> 01:56:19.457
we using cheap material oils and

01:56:21.595 --> 01:56:24.463
admits highly imperfect design,
it helps us to establish the

01:56:25.999 --> 01:56:28.768
case for getting outside funding
in order to move forward with

01:56:30.504 --> 01:56:33.239
well and a better. I think we're
all on board on that. The

01:56:33.907 --> 01:56:35.907
question here is there there's a

01:56:36.944 --> 01:56:39.212
trade off posed here, which is
if you want to do the halfway

01:56:40.147 --> 01:56:42.147
measure here, you've got to live

01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:44.950
with people going wrong way on a

01:56:45.919 --> 01:56:47.919
facility. And I'm not sure

01:56:47.988 --> 01:56:50.956
that's a choice we want to make.
I mean, the first rule for

01:56:52.326 --> 01:56:54.561
doctors is do no harm. And I
think that's the question being

01:56:56.697 --> 01:56:59.399
raised by by this design. If
it's essentially encouraging

01:57:02.536 --> 01:57:05.505
illegal use of the facility, we
well, I'll let staff speak to

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:08.240
that. I feel firmly that this

01:57:08.475 --> 01:57:10.475
accepts the existing behavior

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.800
and makes that behavior far

01:57:14.449 --> 01:57:17.117
safer and more comfortable than
the current condition does as we

01:57:17.919 --> 01:57:19.919
work to identify funding in

01:57:20.254 --> 01:57:22.254
order to solve it fully. That

01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:24.790
right turn there is going to

01:57:25.626 --> 01:57:27.626
where is that going to 101 or

01:57:27.829 --> 01:57:29.829
going into a city stree

01:57:33.634 --> 01:57:35.634
going to bevmo. O it's going to

01:57:35.737 --> 01:57:38.605
the to the oh, it's yeah, just a
street. How about you answering

01:57:39.741 --> 01:57:41.741
that question? Yeah. Soe can

01:57:41.743 --> 01:57:44.311
just walk through. I think it's
exactly as director tomlin said

01:57:45.781 --> 01:57:47.781
it's understanding that there's

01:57:48.250 --> 01:57:50.351
existing behavior and trying to
make it as safe as possible

01:57:53.321 --> 01:57:55.556
while there is a essentially by
the way, marin is a city street

01:57:57.158 --> 01:57:59.158
and it goes right into the dpw

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.960
yard right there. The issue with

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.320
making this a contraflow, two

01:58:06.468 --> 01:58:09.337
way contraflow lane here is that
there is a pinch point at gerald

01:58:10.806 --> 01:58:13.700
where the lane really narrows
down to nine feet. And then we

01:58:13.442 --> 01:58:15.476
have a conflict issue. But I'll
let mark walk you through that

01:58:17.813 --> 01:58:20.781
real quick. Um, hi, everyone. So
up on the screen is our proposed

01:58:20.917 --> 01:58:22.917
design. It shows that one way

01:58:22.918 --> 01:58:25.854
protected bike rail. And as you
can see when you're on bayshore

01:58:26.355 --> 01:58:28.923
itself, you have a pretty
generous nine foot wide lane.

01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.580
And then a pretty generous

01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:34.162
buffer. But as you go southbound
towards gerald, it starts to

01:58:35.230 --> 01:58:37.431
tighten because of the slip lane
that's there. You have an

01:58:38.601 --> 01:58:41.203
adjacent 11 foot lane. You
continue point to where you

01:58:41.671 --> 01:58:43.671
saying, sorry, this is really a

01:58:43.673 --> 01:58:45.673
this is not really a user

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.680
friendly graphic here. Yeah um.

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.160
Yeah. So if you see where the

01:58:56.190 --> 01:58:58.287
cursor is on bayshore itself,
you have a nine foot wide bike

01:58:59.155 --> 01:59:01.155
lane with a I think it's a eight

01:59:01.191 --> 01:59:03.191
foot wide buffer, but as you

01:59:04.393 --> 01:59:06.393
move south towards gerald, where

01:59:06.429 --> 01:59:08.429
the cursor is now, the bike lane

01:59:08.531 --> 01:59:10.699
is nine feet. But then you don't
have a buffer anymore because

01:59:11.734 --> 01:59:13.936
you have a travel lane for that
slip lane. So because of that,

01:59:14.972 --> 01:59:17.707
we run out of space to have an
adequate buffer and it becomes

01:59:18.108 --> 01:59:20.108
tight for two two way cyclists

01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:23.679
to maneuver on that area,
especially as we have the

01:59:24.481 --> 01:59:26.582
southbound bicyclist crossing
gerald, because that's the path

01:59:27.317 --> 01:59:29.317
that they would use. They'd have

01:59:29.819 --> 01:59:32.589
to get onto that median right
here, this pork chop island. My

01:59:34.491 --> 01:59:37.193
cursor is at. And right now the
curb ramps are not aligned.

01:59:37.661 --> 01:59:39.661
They're kind of skewed. And so

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:42.298
it makes it difficult to make a
turn if you're going southbound

01:59:42.466 --> 01:59:45.267
as a bike or towards gerald as a
bike. And having to make a right

01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:49.172
to cross the street as well as
watch out for oncoming traffic

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.375
that's coming through that slip
lane. So we felt it got really

01:59:53.411 --> 01:59:56.346
tight in that area and that to
put a two way would not be

01:59:58.616 --> 02:00:00.750
intuitive for those who don't
bike here regularly. So for them

02:00:03.187 --> 02:00:05.688
to end up at that point and not
know how to cross gerald going

02:00:06.157 --> 02:00:08.692
southbound wouldn't make sense.
And that's why we decided to

02:00:10.428 --> 02:00:12.428
make it a one way right now. You

02:00:13.397 --> 02:00:15.498
do have the sidewalk so you
won't have northbound bicyclists

02:00:15.967 --> 02:00:17.967
on the sidewalk. You'd only have

02:00:18.536 --> 02:00:20.536
southbound bicyclists and that's

02:00:21.710 --> 02:00:23.710
six foot wide sidewalk shown and

02:00:23.141 --> 02:00:25.141
it'd be protected with rail

02:00:25.643 --> 02:00:27.643
compared today where it's just

02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:29.813
sharrows, it's class three, you
would call it. So it does

02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:33.149
provide separation between

02:00:34.852 --> 02:00:36.852
vehicles and bikes as they cross

02:00:44.262 --> 02:00:46.262
through here. DR. Henderson, did

02:00:51.336 --> 02:00:53.336
you have a question. I remember

02:00:54.172 --> 02:00:56.541
that there was some quick build
projects that were happening on

02:00:56.541 --> 02:00:58.541
bayshore, but this is not part

02:00:59.978 --> 02:01:01.978
of that. This is a completely

02:01:12.724 --> 02:01:14.724
different. Okay. And okay.

02:01:15.227 --> 02:01:17.495
So sorry, were you finished? Did
you have more questions? Okay

02:01:22.735 --> 02:01:24.735
okay. And we have closed public

02:01:26.605 --> 02:01:29.340
comment. Kent do we have
additional questions from board

02:01:33.846 --> 02:01:35.846
members? I did have a question

02:01:37.917 --> 02:01:40.752
in similar to I missed staff's
facial expression when they

02:01:41.821 --> 02:01:43.821
responded to director henderson.

02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:46.690
Um, so this is not part of the

02:01:46.859 --> 02:01:48.859
bayshore. Quick build project or

02:01:50.663 --> 02:01:53.632
is it? It's not part of the
bayshore. There are two separate

02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:58.350
projects, separate. Mm. Okay and

02:01:59.272 --> 02:02:01.272
does the bayshore quick little

02:02:03.576 --> 02:02:05.576
project. I'm assuming it's

02:02:07.614 --> 02:02:10.583
roughly this way. That's, that's
already constructed, right. No

02:02:13.119 --> 02:02:15.119
wait I'm just trying to see if

02:02:15.221 --> 02:02:17.221
there's similar project

02:02:18.910 --> 02:02:20.692
boundaries. Yeah, that's
correct. The bayshore quick

02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:23.261
build project has already been

02:02:28.769 --> 02:02:31.737
installed. This is. Okay. Um I
think I'm done for now. Thank

02:02:34.808 --> 02:02:37.643
you. Please. Sorry, I don't bike
in this area, so I'm just trying

02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:40.779
to really grasp the experience
of somebody traveling southbound

02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:46.152
and trying to understand where
they're coming from, how they're

02:02:49.234 --> 02:02:50.666
connecting and how they're going
into gerald or not going into
gerald, perhaps still going on

02:02:51.825 --> 02:02:54.694
to bayshore. Um, if you could
walk us through that a little

02:02:55.762 --> 02:02:58.640
bit just so I can that could be
better illustrated for me and

02:02:59.232 --> 02:03:01.635
possibly members of the public.
Like, are they coming from marin

02:03:02.637 --> 02:03:04.637
coming down? Like, how, how are

02:03:04.772 --> 02:03:06.772
they getting south? Sure I think

02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.909
pulling up google street view
might be a that would be

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:12.912
wonderful because that's what
we've been doing. Like chair

02:03:13.414 --> 02:03:15.414
ekin and I have we have our

02:03:15.783 --> 02:03:17.783
google maps up and running right

02:03:29.296 --> 02:03:31.931
now.
So it's a terrible experience.

02:03:32.767 --> 02:03:34.767
It sounds like it doesn't sound

02:03:44.846 --> 02:03:47.480
fun at all. Why is it called the
hairball? Why is it called the

02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:50.490
hairball? Because it literally

02:03:50.952 --> 02:03:52.952
looks like a like a terrible,

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:00.260
like wonderful. Oh, I see. I see

02:04:04.198 --> 02:04:06.198
. That mike's on. Can you just.

02:04:06.868 --> 02:04:09.103
You can talk from that mike. You
can use that lower mic if it's

02:04:09.437 --> 02:04:11.437
more helpful. Oh, okay. Does it.

02:04:13.876 --> 02:04:16.778
Oh, great. Perfect. Okay, so up
on the screen, I have a aerial

02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:20.982
view of the location in
question. So this is the
intersection of bayshore and

02:04:22.484 --> 02:04:24.552
marin and basically the bike
movement today that happens is

02:04:25.353 --> 02:04:27.855
you have northbound cyclists
coming from bayshore or

02:04:29.191 --> 02:04:31.191
approaching marin crossing this

02:04:32.428 --> 02:04:34.829
crosswalk and then getting onto
this sidewalk. That's considered

02:04:35.731 --> 02:04:38.320
a shared use path for
pedestrians and bikes. And then

02:04:39.168 --> 02:04:41.636
conversely, southbound
bicyclists come from this same

02:04:43.405 --> 02:04:46.375
path going southbound and get
off on this little curb ramp

02:04:47.477 --> 02:04:49.644
here. It's kind of hard to see
from aerial view, but there's a

02:04:50.847 --> 02:04:53.140
curb ramp here and then cross
along this crosswalk here and

02:04:53.182 --> 02:04:55.883
continue south on the sidewalk.
And that's the bicycle movement

02:04:58.354 --> 02:05:00.354
today. Got it. And from this

02:05:00.856 --> 02:05:02.856
from that sidewalk, how do they

02:05:03.590 --> 02:05:05.590
end up connecting with the bike

02:05:07.464 --> 02:05:09.565
path, going southbound? What's
their route of travel? How do

02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:12.968
they transition out of that?
Yeah. So as they continue down

02:05:13.690 --> 02:05:15.690
south on the sidewalk, they go

02:05:15.138 --> 02:05:17.138
around this curve approaching

02:05:17.273 --> 02:05:19.273
gerald, which is right over

02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:22.712
here, the slip lane. This is the
intersection of gerald. And
there's another ramp on here

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.248
that they get down on and they
cross across his bike, across

02:05:27.170 --> 02:05:29.251
this crossing through this pork
chop island and then through

02:05:29.685 --> 02:05:31.685
this crossing again over here

02:05:31.855 --> 02:05:33.922
where there's these green back
arrows and then continue on.

02:05:36.726 --> 02:05:38.726
Gerald eastbound or south.

02:05:40.197 --> 02:05:42.197
Eastbound, yeah. And this

02:05:43.634 --> 02:05:45.434
project or this item wouldn't do
anything to change that

02:05:46.837 --> 02:05:48.837
behavior. Yeah so that behavior

02:05:48.939 --> 02:05:51.107
would still happen. It's only
just to protect the northbound

02:05:51.942 --> 02:05:53.942
cyclists that are going through

02:05:53.944 --> 02:05:56.146
this through. Gerald right now,
if you're coming from gerald and

02:05:56.881 --> 02:05:58.881
you're going to go along,

02:05:59.817 --> 02:06:01.851
continue north and you see how
this bike lane kind of drops

02:06:03.654 --> 02:06:05.855
off, you see the green drops off
and it turns into a right turn

02:06:06.490 --> 02:06:09.125
pocket. So the proposal is to
convert this right turn pocket

02:06:09.125 --> 02:06:11.460
into that nine foot bike lane
with a eight foot buffer

02:06:11.495 --> 02:06:13.495
protected by concrete rail so

02:06:14.365 --> 02:06:16.700
that we can continue that bike
lane from gerald up to marin.

02:06:19.203 --> 02:06:21.671
And into this into the path that
people use today. Okay. Thank

02:06:23.107 --> 02:06:25.107
you. This is super helpful. Um,

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:29.479
an and if I understand this
correctly, this is the first

02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:33.149
phase of it seems like a more

02:06:34.285 --> 02:06:36.285
involved project. Do you have an

02:06:36.888 --> 02:06:38.888
approximate timeline for that

02:06:40.358 --> 02:06:42.492
second phase? Yeah so there is a
second phase, but I'll leave it

02:06:43.461 --> 02:06:45.729
to talia to give you the update
on timeline. Sorry, this is a

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:49.466
team effort. It, it's all good.

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:51.735
Yeah. So we are in the process

02:06:53.171 --> 02:06:55.906
of starting detailed design on
our long term work here and

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:58.141
that's something that will go

02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:02.211
through public works to get to

02:07:02.814 --> 02:07:04.648
100. Then we are going to be
looking for funding for the

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.951
capital improvement. So it's a

02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:10.755
ways out which is why we are
aiming to get some of these near

02:07:13.358 --> 02:07:16.294
term improvements in sooner.
Okay. So can I just jump in? I

02:07:16.661 --> 02:07:18.661
see you in the queue, director.

02:07:18.897 --> 02:07:21.131
So, but just related to that,
can you just help us understand

02:07:21.699 --> 02:07:23.968
we know this is a pattern that's
happening. Even the director

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:26.169
admits this is the path of

02:07:27.139 --> 02:07:29.274
travel he takes. Is there
nothing we could do in a near

02:07:30.842 --> 02:07:33.744
term quick build fashion that
could address and provide a
safer treatment for those

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:37.314
heading southbound and then is
that larger capital going to

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:41.685
address the problem and how this

02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:45.880
is given in the pinch point? At

02:07:45.257 --> 02:07:47.257
gerald, we deem this the safest

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:50.127
option to do right now in terms
of make making sure that folks

02:07:50.563 --> 02:07:53.297
don't get to another conflict
once they're going southbound

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:57.340
and they get to gerald street.
So, yes, I would say it's the

02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:59.770
safest option that we have right

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:01.772
now on the table to just be able

02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:05.109
to get rid of that right turn

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:07.244
pocket and protect that stretch

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:09.346
of bike lane with our concrete

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.417
barriers. So that's going to be
the safest option. It's just to

02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.180
protect whatever movements

02:08:15.222 --> 02:08:17.323
happening in that area between
the vehicle traffic and the

02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:20.240
sidewalk in the bike lane. So,

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.695
yes, that's what we're we
believe this was the best

02:08:22.695 --> 02:08:25.597
option. That's why we brought it
in front of you today. In terms

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.400
of the long term, we have some

02:08:29.736 --> 02:08:31.736
options as it's still being

02:08:32.573 --> 02:08:35.474
design lined, but we have some
options for that intersection at

02:08:37.244 --> 02:08:40.145
marin to help that crossing
because that's actually where we

02:08:40.413 --> 02:08:42.413
see the most conflict. That's is

02:08:45.852 --> 02:08:48.720
that crossing across from that
bike lane into the actual

02:08:48.788 --> 02:08:50.788
pathway that goes underneath the

02:08:51.191 --> 02:08:53.191
overpass. And that's where we've

02:08:53.327 --> 02:08:56.950
seen a severe injury happen
before. And so we're doing some

02:08:56.363 --> 02:08:58.363
work around creating a raised

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:01.660
crosswalk there and changing our

02:09:02.235 --> 02:09:04.336
curb ramps to align properly and
some other treatments to help

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:09.576
with that area. And I will say
that that the long term design

02:09:10.770 --> 02:09:12.770
is still being designed. So

02:09:12.213 --> 02:09:14.180
there's some work to come from
that. And is the raised

02:09:16.584 --> 02:09:18.785
crosswalk, is that a near term
project? Does it have funding?

02:09:18.852 --> 02:09:20.852
That's part of our long term.

02:09:21.210 --> 02:09:23.210
That's part of the long term.

02:09:27.428 --> 02:09:29.428
Got it. Director. So. Um MAY I

02:09:29.563 --> 02:09:31.563
ask you this question on that

02:09:33.267 --> 02:09:35.267
stretch between marin and cesar

02:09:37.638 --> 02:09:39.605
chavez? Early on, you described
basically from my understanding

02:09:40.874 --> 02:09:42.874
of I get it correctly, is that

02:09:42.944 --> 02:09:45.846
both northbound and southbound
bicyclists will be basically

02:09:48.416 --> 02:09:50.416
crammed in that segment right.

02:09:51.919 --> 02:09:53.919
You mean the shared multi-use

02:09:56.490 --> 02:09:58.490
pathway? So director la kahina

02:09:59.226 --> 02:10:01.462
was asking, explain to us how
people move around right now

02:10:02.397 --> 02:10:04.397
with the northbound and

02:10:04.499 --> 02:10:06.499
southbound. And you describe up

02:10:06.534 --> 02:10:08.534
to the marin street

02:10:08.903 --> 02:10:10.903
intersections on bayshore, but

02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:14.140
some like I'm assuming along the

02:10:14.842 --> 02:10:16.842
bayshore boulevard between marin

02:10:18.447 --> 02:10:21.820
to cesar chavez, both northbound
and southbound bicyclists will

02:10:25.921 --> 02:10:27.921
be using the same space right.

02:10:28.230 --> 02:10:30.758
Currently I'm asking currently
what the correct currently

02:10:31.726 --> 02:10:34.261
that's what that's what happens
both northbound and southbound

02:10:35.197 --> 02:10:37.197
bikes use that space on the

02:10:37.633 --> 02:10:40.602
sidewalk as a shared use path to
maneuver through that area. Okay

02:10:43.272 --> 02:10:45.272
and how why is that sidewalk. I

02:10:47.242 --> 02:10:49.242
think think it's six feet

02:10:49.278 --> 02:10:51.278
minimum. I'm not exactly sure of

02:10:51.947 --> 02:10:53.915
the exact width and how was
what's the minimum width of our

02:10:55.170 --> 02:10:57.170
bike lane that you design? It

02:10:59.188 --> 02:11:01.956
depends on many factors. I guess
the minimum you can go down to

02:11:02.725 --> 02:11:04.492
is four feet, and that's
typically if you don't have a

02:11:05.461 --> 02:11:07.461
gutter, that's great. So the one

02:11:07.663 --> 02:11:09.663
that in your proposed project,

02:11:09.666 --> 02:11:11.666
right, which is that segment

02:11:12.568 --> 02:11:15.400
between marin and gerald, which
is the next block south from

02:11:16.172 --> 02:11:18.172
what I just asked, you're a new

02:11:19.942 --> 02:11:21.942
bike lane is nine feet only to

02:11:21.978 --> 02:11:23.978
northbound why can we cut it in

02:11:25.414 --> 02:11:28.184
half if four feet for northbound
and four feet for southbound?

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.787
Because I'm going to say that I
think I really believe what luke

02:11:32.922 --> 02:11:35.457
was mentioning. I have a child
myself and my child's school is

02:11:38.261 --> 02:11:40.261
from preschool to middle school

02:11:40.563 --> 02:11:42.964
and I've seen a lot more parents
are now riding these pretty big

02:11:44.166 --> 02:11:46.166
bikes, you know, that can fit

02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:48.270
like two kids on the back.

02:11:50.507 --> 02:11:52.541
They're not our european fancy
version of like, you know,

02:11:54.344 --> 02:11:56.645
skinny two wheeled. There are
there are a lot of things that

02:11:57.547 --> 02:11:59.547
come along with it. Luke had a

02:11:59.983 --> 02:12:01.983
really good point, like you guys

02:12:02.252 --> 02:12:04.252
just say, they can't simply go

02:12:04.255 --> 02:12:06.255
around these that fire hydrant

02:12:06.857 --> 02:12:09.759
which is active sounds like it's
confirmed by you. And also the

02:12:11.595 --> 02:12:13.595
pga power pole. So I would love

02:12:13.864 --> 02:12:15.864
to see family that actually

02:12:17.634 --> 02:12:20.437
feels safe on their way to
school and on their way back

02:12:23.274 --> 02:12:25.508
home. And if we have to make a
choice with the limited

02:12:26.777 --> 02:12:28.777
resources that we have, I think

02:12:29.146 --> 02:12:31.146
that simply we can do is that

02:12:31.248 --> 02:12:33.983
instead of telling people this
is only for one direction, then

02:12:36.453 --> 02:12:39.156
we can simply make a signage to
make aware of all the cyclists

02:12:41.793 --> 02:12:43.793
or people who chose to whatever

02:12:44.362 --> 02:12:47.230
wheel they're rolling that they
are in this new area that we are

02:12:47.365 --> 02:12:50.100
creating to protect, to save
lives. Everyone is aware of

02:12:51.469 --> 02:12:53.469
that. People are now going to be

02:12:53.737 --> 02:12:55.737
really tight and they have to

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.840
slow down. And because they're

02:12:57.876 --> 02:12:59.876
expecting them to be sharing the

02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:03.981
same space for north and south,
can we accommodate that? Because

02:13:05.516 --> 02:13:07.516
it would be really confusing to

02:13:07.518 --> 02:13:10.253
only limit it. I mean, we know
that for reality, the parents

02:13:11.122 --> 02:13:13.925
are not going to be try to
squeeze through the building and

02:13:14.393 --> 02:13:16.393
the fire hydrant. And then

02:13:17.195 --> 02:13:20.640
because I really don't want to
see a kid's leg got clipped by

02:13:20.765 --> 02:13:23.500
the wall of the building or the
fire hydrant, they are going to

02:13:25.690 --> 02:13:27.271
be put putting them into that
nine foot wide bike lane and

02:13:28.406 --> 02:13:31.209
that's a very generous width for
one way direction because I want

02:13:32.945 --> 02:13:35.513
to challenge if we I want to
know, is it possible to cut that

02:13:36.648 --> 02:13:39.216
in half? Because you said that
the minimum bike lane is four

02:13:39.518 --> 02:13:42.186
feet and now you're creating a
new bike lane that is nine feet

02:13:42.287 --> 02:13:44.287
wide, only one direction down.

02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:47.224
Yeah it has to do with where it
leads to. That pinch point at

02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:51.261
gerald is the reason why there's

02:13:53.381 --> 02:13:55.500
not a two way bike lane. It's
not because of the width of the
space that we have. It's because

02:13:55.701 --> 02:13:58.469
of where it leads to and the
conflicts that that can lead to.

02:13:59.938 --> 02:14:01.938
Once it pinches down. Okay I

02:14:02.307 --> 02:14:04.307
would like you to consider the

02:14:04.544 --> 02:14:06.711
practicality of the reality of
how people actually are going to

02:14:08.147 --> 02:14:10.147
use the space instead of the

02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:13.830
pinch point on your turn radius

02:14:13.152 --> 02:14:15.152
or whatever else. The technical

02:14:16.255 --> 02:14:18.323
end hearing is because
practically we have a parent

02:14:19.758 --> 02:14:21.993
sitting over there and I have a
lot of parents that I knew that

02:14:22.228 --> 02:14:24.228
is actually traveling around

02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:26.730
this area. Um I would love to

02:14:27.133 --> 02:14:29.133
not seeing any kids getting

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:32.737
injured or any parents have to
try to haphazardly try to dodge

02:14:35.875 --> 02:14:38.430
this new protected lane. And in
the end, actually not protecting

02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:42.800
them. Director henzi, I see you

02:14:42.983 --> 02:14:44.983
in the queue, but I also just

02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:47.180
want to jump in and ask what

02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:49.254
would it take if the board
doesn't approve this today and

02:14:49.556 --> 02:14:51.556
we ask you to actually formalize

02:14:52.125 --> 02:14:54.192
a space for people to move in
both directions safely, which

02:14:55.610 --> 02:14:57.229
might involve looking at that
slip lane and whether that

02:14:57.330 --> 02:14:59.866
should be closed off. Because
there's another way to access

02:15:00.467 --> 02:15:02.467
bayshore anyway, we what would

02:15:02.535 --> 02:15:04.535
it take for you to just go ahead

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:07.840
and do that and come back to us?
I think it just takes further

02:15:08.241 --> 02:15:09.775
design review. We have looked at
options. There's a lot of

02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:12.410
traffic impacts, etcetera, and

02:15:13.713 --> 02:15:16.490
there that pork chop that you
see there has a major utility

02:15:17.818 --> 02:15:20.119
pole in there. So we've looked
at different options to try to

02:15:22.423 --> 02:15:24.657
get around this and we have kind
of come to this place, but we

02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:27.727
can go back and do further
design if that's what's needed.

02:15:28.528 --> 02:15:30.529
Have you looked at the idea of
shortening or eliminating the

02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:36.236
slip? Yeah that was a thing that
we were looking at. The only

02:15:37.104 --> 02:15:40.730
difficulty with that is you do
have a fire station on gerald

02:15:40.307 --> 02:15:42.307
and they use that slip lane to

02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.745
access you know, the city from
that area and it becomes

02:15:47.614 --> 02:15:49.682
difficult for them if you close
it out because it gets pretty

02:15:54.689 --> 02:15:57.224
tight. Around that pork chop
island. It makes it difficult to

02:15:57.325 --> 02:15:59.325
make that turnaround it so the

02:16:00.728 --> 02:16:03.696
slip lane provides fire access
in the event of an emergency. So

02:16:04.298 --> 02:16:06.299
we did float that idea of either
calming down traffic through

02:16:09.452 --> 02:16:11.452
that slip lane or closing it out

02:16:11.639 --> 02:16:13.639
. But we were at a standstill,

02:16:14.275 --> 02:16:16.275
essentially. We've been through

02:16:16.410 --> 02:16:18.410
our internal coordination with

02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.250
fire and other entities to try
to come up with the best

02:16:23.617 --> 02:16:25.586
solution on. And someone
mentioned before, there's a lot

02:16:27.122 --> 02:16:29.656
of things we end up grappling
with. And so we get to this

02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:32.860
place where we try to present
the best solution. An and that's

02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.620
that's where we are. But if we

02:16:37.232 --> 02:16:39.466
can depend on what's needed, go
back to the drawing board and

02:16:41.169 --> 02:16:43.169
see what else can be done. Okay

02:16:43.572 --> 02:16:46.307
director hennessy had her hand,
but did you take that away? I,

02:16:50.479 --> 02:16:52.479
um, I think you sort of answered

02:16:53.248 --> 02:16:55.248
my question, but I'll try anyway

02:16:55.283 --> 02:16:57.283
to see if it elucidates anymore.

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.222
Um I think I was going to ask a
version of the question. Chair

02:17:02.525 --> 02:17:04.525
you can already tried, which is

02:17:06.395 --> 02:17:09.197
i think we're on board with the,
um, the protected bikeway north

02:17:11.967 --> 02:17:13.967
bound, but I just want to know

02:17:15.704 --> 02:17:17.806
if we, we thought we thought
about and I'm sure you have

02:17:19.609 --> 02:17:21.609
again, you think you entered

02:17:21.677 --> 02:17:24.279
this, but if we tried quick
build approaches for the

02:17:27.383 --> 02:17:29.383
southbound, um but possible

02:17:31.653 --> 02:17:33.653
protect lane that are public

02:17:36.893 --> 02:17:38.893
comment or brought up. Yes we

02:17:41.897 --> 02:17:43.897
did look at the possibility of

02:17:44.167 --> 02:17:47.200
making that two way again on the
issue that has come up has been

02:17:47.938 --> 02:17:49.938
the pinch point at gerald and

02:17:53.443 --> 02:17:55.711
the. Lack of ability to do much
with that slip lane. Therefore

02:17:57.747 --> 02:17:59.747
that's where we ended up where

02:18:01.284 --> 02:18:03.284
we are today. Um, we, we in

02:18:03.486 --> 02:18:05.721
thinking about what we could do
quickly to just make our

02:18:07.290 --> 02:18:10.259
existing pattern safer. This is,
this is where we are and we know

02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:13.929
that we can remove that right

02:18:14.731 --> 02:18:16.899
turn pocket and create a good
amount of space there protected

02:18:20.170 --> 02:18:22.170
by our buffer as a way to, to

02:18:22.405 --> 02:18:25.374
take what's existing today. And
add as quickly as possible and

02:18:28.179 --> 02:18:31.800
as vetted internally. As much as
we can make something better. So

02:18:32.916 --> 02:18:34.916
that's how we ended up with what

02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.180
we have today. We did look at

02:18:37.554 --> 02:18:39.554
all the different possibilities.

02:18:41.257 --> 02:18:43.257
Okay, got it. Um and then I

02:18:44.996 --> 02:18:46.996
guess for MADAM City attorney,

02:18:49.333 --> 02:18:51.333
we, we only have the northbound

02:18:53.571 --> 02:18:56.406
direction for us today. So we
could, in theory, take action on

02:18:57.641 --> 02:18:59.641
it and direct staff to do

02:19:01.278 --> 02:19:03.278
further design. Is that correct?

02:19:03.648 --> 02:19:06.450
Thank you, director. I think
your options today are either to

02:19:07.752 --> 02:19:09.752
continue the item for further

02:19:10.454 --> 02:19:12.589
clarification. You know, maybe a
more fulsome staff report with

02:19:14.258 --> 02:19:17.227
drawings or are to deny the
project with direction to staff.

02:19:19.965 --> 02:19:22.990
You can't modify the project
today first because there aren't

02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:25.102
we don't know what's feasible.
And second, because it's not

02:19:27.605 --> 02:19:30.574
right. Agendized for that or you
can approve the item as

02:19:32.777 --> 02:19:34.777
presented as well. Right. Okay

02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:40.651
DR. Henderson. Thank you. I just
wanted to point out my question

02:19:42.187 --> 02:19:44.889
about was this part of the quick
build is because it feels like

02:19:46.424 --> 02:19:48.424
this is a huge artery that we

02:19:48.693 --> 02:19:51.662
have a couple of different
projects on excuse me, to

02:19:53.364 --> 02:19:55.867
address in the near or, you
know, to address immediately.

02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.670
But it feels like because you
call it the hair ball, it sounds

02:19:59.805 --> 02:20:01.805
like it's complicated and a mess

02:20:02.741 --> 02:20:05.710
and I would think that we would
prioritize this in the list of

02:20:07.345 --> 02:20:09.345
capital projects so that we

02:20:10.348 --> 02:20:12.348
don't get satisfied by these

02:20:12.451 --> 02:20:14.451
immediate improvements to safety

02:20:15.688 --> 02:20:17.688
and then not really have the

02:20:19.925 --> 02:20:22.527
long term improvements in mind
because it feels like, you know,

02:20:23.662 --> 02:20:25.662
we can say yes to various quick

02:20:25.664 --> 02:20:27.664
builds to improve safety, and I

02:20:30.102 --> 02:20:32.904
support that. But we got to
figure out some. I just don't

02:20:35.341 --> 02:20:37.341
want the timing of this to then

02:20:39.512 --> 02:20:41.579
somehow lower the priority for
the improvements to this

02:20:43.315 --> 02:20:45.315
particular section of the

02:20:47.687 --> 02:20:49.687
streets and so I just wonder if

02:20:50.290 --> 02:20:52.758
there's a more or maybe we can
hear later about about the long

02:20:55.128 --> 02:20:57.862
term plan so that this can be
high on the list of capital

02:20:58.497 --> 02:21:00.497
items that we address maybe

02:21:02.401 --> 02:21:04.336
through some hopefully through
some grant applications or

02:21:06.139 --> 02:21:08.139
something. But I just think that

02:21:08.175 --> 02:21:10.175
we're kind of figuring out where

02:21:10.744 --> 02:21:13.278
the hard points are and dealing
with it. And then the long term

02:21:15.548 --> 02:21:18.350
vision just becomes out of out
of sight, out of mind a little

02:21:18.951 --> 02:21:20.819
bit. So I don't I don't know
that there's a question there,

02:21:21.254 --> 02:21:23.254
but that's just my concern about

02:21:23.323 --> 02:21:25.191
this particular project. Thank
you, director henderson,

02:21:27.527 --> 02:21:29.528
director tomlin. So to direct to
answer director henderson's

02:21:30.597 --> 02:21:33.266
question, this is, as staff
described, they are working on

02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:36.735
detailed design for a longer
term solution that would cost

02:21:37.937 --> 02:21:40.440
more in capital resources than
we currently have access to. So

02:21:42.443 --> 02:21:44.443
again, this is a short term

02:21:45.479 --> 02:21:47.479
impact movement that is aimed at

02:21:47.481 --> 02:21:49.481
helping us get the resources

02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:52.952
that we need for a much, much
longer term fix. But one of the

02:21:53.530 --> 02:21:55.988
things that I'm hearing from all
of you is that the direction

02:21:56.958 --> 02:21:58.958
that we had heard to move

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.228
really, really quickly in order
to maximize safety of the

02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:04.631
network to the extent that we
could, given our staff

02:22:04.732 --> 02:22:06.800
constraints, that's and our
capital resources that we have

02:22:08.435 --> 02:22:10.903
aired that we have, we have
moved too fast. And you would

02:22:13.273 --> 02:22:15.509
like us to slow down the pace of
the improvements in the network

02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:19.413
in order to bring you more up to
speed on the design details and

02:22:20.515 --> 02:22:22.649
present some of the choices that
I think staff have resolved at

02:22:23.684 --> 02:22:25.684
the staff level and perhaps do

02:22:27.388 --> 02:22:29.388
spend a lot less time on rapid

02:22:29.557 --> 02:22:31.557
expansion of the network and

02:22:31.693 --> 02:22:33.693
instead spend more time on

02:22:35.196 --> 02:22:37.196
fewer, more capitalized projects

02:22:40.401 --> 02:22:43.700
that. That would get stronger. I
wouldn't characterize it that

02:22:43.771 --> 02:22:46.374
way. I would say what I'm
hearing from director henderson
is we're we're dealing with this

02:22:46.374 --> 02:22:48.475
particular issue right now.
We're putting attention into it.

02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:52.280
We're trying to fix it. But as
we're hearing from the public,

02:22:53.810 --> 02:22:55.810
we're not fixing it. So this is

02:22:57.752 --> 02:23:00.521
the shot and if we're not form,
if we're not going to improve

02:23:00.655 --> 02:23:02.655
safety, why are we going to

02:23:03.291 --> 02:23:05.325
improve, improve this project? I
would say that it does improve

02:23:06.328 --> 02:23:08.328
safety. And even for the south

02:23:08.364 --> 02:23:10.465
bound, even even for the south
bound, because we're putting

02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:13.500
we're replacing what is sharrows

02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:16.103
and a right turn pocket with a
full protected bike lane

02:23:16.571 --> 02:23:18.571
protected by concrete barriers

02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:21.475
and there's other portions of
this that do do some

02:23:23.544 --> 02:23:25.614
improvements in the area, but
the formal signage will still

02:23:25.648 --> 02:23:27.648
tell people to go on the

02:23:30.152 --> 02:23:32.287
sidewalk. Yes but I absolutely
believe that it's a safety

02:23:35.958 --> 02:23:37.958
improvement. Please go ahead. I

02:23:39.294 --> 02:23:41.294
think it would be the best use

02:23:42.310 --> 02:23:44.650
of our time to continue the
item. Just to give staff ample

02:23:44.434 --> 02:23:46.434
opportunity to explain the

02:23:46.602 --> 02:23:48.602
project with all their designs.

02:23:49.538 --> 02:23:51.539
And I know we tried to solve for
things right now with like

02:23:52.308 --> 02:23:54.776
google maps and things like
that. So I just want to give

02:23:55.978 --> 02:23:57.612
folks a fair shot to really
present the best version of this

02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:00.480
project to this to this board

02:24:02.452 --> 02:24:04.686
and to the public like so I
would like to formally make a

02:24:05.822 --> 02:24:08.724
motion just to continue the item
so that folks have ample time to

02:24:09.459 --> 02:24:12.394
explain this in more detail. I
know we have other things on the

02:24:12.929 --> 02:24:14.929
agenda, so I just want to keep

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:19.235
it pushing to a second. Okay
let's please call the roll on

02:24:20.470 --> 02:24:22.470
the motion to continue. Item

02:24:22.639 --> 02:24:24.639
10.2 b to a future meeting.

02:24:25.341 --> 02:24:28.177
Director hemminger hemminger.
Director henderson henderson.

02:24:30.313 --> 02:24:32.313
Director hinsey. Hi, director.

02:24:33.182 --> 02:24:35.182
So I. So I. Director kehena. Hi

02:24:36.119 --> 02:24:38.119
kehena. I chair. Hi ekin. I

02:24:38.355 --> 02:24:40.523
thank you. That is approved.
Thank you. And we'll now take

02:24:40.624 --> 02:24:42.624
the remainder of the consent

02:24:43.594 --> 02:24:45.594
calendar. That's I think 10.2

02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:49.431
are a b b. Those are the class
two and class three bike lane

02:24:50.433 --> 02:24:53.103
facilities. Is there any public
comment from anyone in the room

02:24:55.139 --> 02:24:57.139
on these proposed street

02:25:02.681 --> 02:25:05.381
improvements. Hi. Board members.
Luke bornheimer I'll try and

02:25:07.317 --> 02:25:09.317
keep my comments short. We're

02:25:10.421 --> 02:25:13.890
coming up on 2024. It is well
known that class two and class

02:25:13.224 --> 02:25:15.224
three bike lanes and bike

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:18.795
facilities are just just are not
what we should be building in

02:25:19.697 --> 02:25:22.599
cities. Never mind in like a
completely new development where
we want to encourage people to

02:25:24.635 --> 02:25:26.635
not rely on cars and use active

02:25:27.772 --> 02:25:29.772
transportation. An unfortunate I

02:25:29.941 --> 02:25:31.941
think this is a good, good

02:25:33.544 --> 02:25:35.544
example of what happens when

02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:37.580
staff is just trying to make

02:25:37.682 --> 02:25:40.583
things work and something gets
deprioritized and there isn't

02:25:41.585 --> 02:25:43.585
really a hard stop there. So I

02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:46.824
think, you know, I would
encourage you to direct staff to

02:25:47.359 --> 02:25:49.359
make these class four bikeways

02:25:49.461 --> 02:25:52.396
rather than class two or class
three bike routes. And I think

02:25:53.698 --> 02:25:55.698
more broadly, I would encourage

02:25:57.501 --> 02:25:59.501
you to establish policy that

02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:02.640
tells staff they cannot create
anything but a class four

02:26:03.775 --> 02:26:05.775
bikeway because otherwise what

02:26:05.777 --> 02:26:08.790
we see and I've seen this time
and again is that projects get

02:26:08.746 --> 02:26:10.614
watered down and whittled down
because, well, there's this one

02:26:12.417 --> 02:26:14.618
spot where the bus needs to go
here or someone needs to park

02:26:15.586 --> 02:26:18.489
here or a fire truck needs to go
here, someone needs to load here

02:26:18.657 --> 02:26:21.292
and all. Always, always, always.
The thing that is cut out is the

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.360
class four bikeway or the

02:26:24.129 --> 02:26:26.129
materials used for it. And so I

02:26:26.732 --> 02:26:28.732
think like I think what staff

02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:31.135
and the agency and the people of
san francisco need is you to

02:26:31.436 --> 02:26:33.337
actually just create a policy
that says we don't do class two

02:26:34.339 --> 02:26:36.774
and class three bikeways
anymore. We just we just only do

02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.900
class four bikeways. And that's

02:26:39.450 --> 02:26:41.212
because there's a mountain of
data that shows that this is

02:26:41.414 --> 02:26:43.315
safer and it's better for
business and better for the

02:26:44.490 --> 02:26:46.384
climate and better, obviously,
for people's safety. So that's a

02:26:46.452 --> 02:26:48.452
broader suggestion. But in this

02:26:49.922 --> 02:26:52.690
case, yeah, I urge you to direct
staff to make these class four

02:26:52.724 --> 02:26:54.724
bikeways instead of class two

02:26:54.861 --> 02:26:57.620
bike lanes and class three bike
routes, which are essentially

02:26:57.263 --> 02:27:00.165
just a green splotch of paint on
a on a car lane. Thank you.

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.201
Thank you. Any other speakers in
the room? Okay. Seeing none,

02:27:05.504 --> 02:27:07.605
please open a remote at this
time, we'll move to remote

02:27:08.374 --> 02:27:11.276
public comment not to exceed ten
minutes. Members of the public

02:27:11.845 --> 02:27:14.460
wishing to comment should dial
star three to enter the queue.

02:27:14.147 --> 02:27:16.147
Each speaker will have two

02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:21.486
minutes. Moderator for speaker.
Hi, this is michael howley. I

02:27:22.522 --> 02:27:24.522
want to thank the board for

02:27:24.623 --> 02:27:26.623
covering these items and I the

02:27:27.493 --> 02:27:29.493
same work that takes me through

02:27:30.464 --> 02:27:33.650
the hairball area on my bike
also takes me to treasure island

02:27:34.401 --> 02:27:36.401
quite frequently and I don't

02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:39.138
know how many of you have been
out there lately, but it's a

02:27:39.906 --> 02:27:41.906
really weird hodgepodge of bike

02:27:43.576 --> 02:27:46.411
facilities. You get some class
four lanes, nice and protected

02:27:47.581 --> 02:27:49.581
and a really nice multi-use path

02:27:49.650 --> 02:27:52.485
along avenue of the palms and
around the corner. It feels

02:27:54.387 --> 02:27:56.387
great. And then suddenly you're

02:27:56.857 --> 02:27:59.758
in a class two lane and then you
get a class four lane again and

02:28:00.627 --> 02:28:03.529
for an area of the city that are
essentially rebuilding from
scratch, it's so weird to me

02:28:05.499 --> 02:28:07.499
that there are already proposing

02:28:09.236 --> 02:28:11.838
these week paint only
facilities. I know the roads on

02:28:16.443 --> 02:28:19.178
on mccalla is item a and b are a
little weirder maybe that's

02:28:19.346 --> 02:28:21.346
really the only option until new

02:28:21.816 --> 02:28:23.816
paths are installed. But yeah, I

02:28:23.885 --> 02:28:26.686
really appreciate the board
already talking about this and

02:28:27.755 --> 02:28:30.390
how it's not really acceptable
to be proposing these totally

02:28:31.759 --> 02:28:34.661
unprotected types of facilities
from the jump. So there's

02:28:35.228 --> 02:28:37.228
anything you can do to fix that

02:28:38.533 --> 02:28:40.533
here or to create policy for

02:28:41.369 --> 02:28:44.338
future projects. Yeah, really
appreciate it. Thank you. Thank

02:28:59.788 --> 02:29:01.788
you. Next speaker.

02:29:05.527 --> 02:29:07.561
Moderator next speaker. Oh, they
lowered their hand. No more

02:29:07.829 --> 02:29:09.829
callers. Okay, we'll close

02:29:11.699 --> 02:29:13.699
public comment on this item. And

02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:16.269
is there are there any questions

02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:19.241
or comments? DR. Kahina, did
your hand was your hand raised

02:29:19.241 --> 02:29:21.842
for this item? Okay. Director
hemminger thank you, MADAM

02:29:22.644 --> 02:29:24.644
Chair. And thank you for

02:29:25.814 --> 02:29:28.148
pointing these out to us,
because I do think it brings up

02:29:30.719 --> 02:29:32.719
a the agenda is not on there.

02:29:34.924 --> 02:29:36.924
I'm sorry. Okay. It's still

02:29:37.593 --> 02:29:39.593
showing 10.2 b, so they're

02:29:40.896 --> 02:29:42.663
asking for a 10.2 r, a and b b
to show up on the screen. Thank

02:29:43.165 --> 02:29:45.165
you for your attention to detail

02:29:49.705 --> 02:29:51.906
. So. The policy question to me,
I mean, I had always understood

02:29:52.410 --> 02:29:54.410
treasure island and the

02:29:54.810 --> 02:29:56.810
redevelopment of it as this

02:29:56.846 --> 02:29:58.846
opportunity to have a showcase

02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:02.150
of sustain transportation. There

02:30:02.170 --> 02:30:04.170
spending a small fortune moving

02:30:05.821 --> 02:30:07.821
the ferry dock from the oakland

02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:11.580
side to the san francisco side

02:30:12.395 --> 02:30:14.563
to make that work. An and it
sounds like they're trying to

02:30:16.198 --> 02:30:18.198
cheap out on the bike network.

02:30:18.867 --> 02:30:21.836
Do you have a sense as let me
ask our engineer how many bike

02:30:23.372 --> 02:30:26.275
lanes how many miles of bike
lane are they putting in and

02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:29.710
what classes are they? I will

02:30:31.881 --> 02:30:34.716
say, say that if there is
interest from the board to have

02:30:34.817 --> 02:30:37.419
a more thorough presentation
about treasure island, the
development happening there and

02:30:37.753 --> 02:30:39.753
how it accommodating bike

02:30:40.524 --> 02:30:42.524
facilities from kind of a large

02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:44.894
perspective rather than kind of
the discrete projects that are

02:30:45.128 --> 02:30:47.128
being presented here. I think we

02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:49.230
can we can work on that. I think

02:30:49.533 --> 02:30:51.533
this is part of a plan that

02:30:51.701 --> 02:30:54.436
staff is bringing forward to
execute what I've already

02:30:55.205 --> 02:30:57.205
approved. Street plans for the

02:30:59.410 --> 02:31:01.611
project. So so it is in a way
this is kind of documenting

02:31:02.512 --> 02:31:04.914
decisions that have already been
discussed with other departments

02:31:05.516 --> 02:31:07.516
that are not at this hearing. So

02:31:09.219 --> 02:31:11.219
from a perspective of providing

02:31:11.254 --> 02:31:13.422
more information about bicycle
planning that went into treasure

02:31:13.723 --> 02:31:15.723
island, I think I would probably

02:31:16.327 --> 02:31:18.461
defer to other staff that are
more familiar with the project

02:31:19.430 --> 02:31:21.564
in terms of specific questions
about what's in front of the

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:25.602
board in the calendar. We I have
brian wu, who's our senior

02:31:25.602 --> 02:31:27.570
engineer, that can answer
questions about specific

02:31:29.606 --> 02:31:31.807
segments, but larger planning
questions, I would I would think

02:31:32.643 --> 02:31:35.178
it's more fair for people that
have been involved in the

02:31:35.413 --> 02:31:37.413
planning to address. Yeah. And

02:31:38.683 --> 02:31:41.251
MADAM Chair, I mean, in lieu of
just going through a lot of

02:31:41.652 --> 02:31:43.652
questions today, I would

02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:46.423
appreciate a chance to look at
this sort of from a global

02:31:49.159 --> 02:31:51.929
perspective and see if we find
that the, the plans that are

02:31:52.764 --> 02:31:54.932
apparently are well advanced are
sort of headed in the right

02:31:55.934 --> 02:31:57.934
direction. An or we're aiming

02:31:58.970 --> 02:32:01.380
too low. Yeah. I mean, look, I'm
familiar with the streets out

02:32:01.872 --> 02:32:03.873
there, too. Some of them like
mccullough. I mean, that's

02:32:04.942 --> 02:32:06.942
that's that's a hairball street.

02:32:08.112 --> 02:32:10.781
But a lot of them are like,
you're in iowa. I mean, they're

02:32:11.116 --> 02:32:13.684
big wide streets and avenues.
And I don't know why you just

02:32:14.552 --> 02:32:16.552
wouldn't put a class one bike

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:20.560
lane everywhere you look. I will

02:32:21.159 --> 02:32:22.960
say that that there's probably a
confusion about right now

02:32:23.661 --> 02:32:26.563
treasure island being in flux.
So there are some things that

02:32:26.631 --> 02:32:29.167
are interim. There are some
things that are being phased in

02:32:30.135 --> 02:32:32.403
and there are some things that
that need to go in later when

02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:35.500
construction is completed. So I

02:32:35.307 --> 02:32:37.408
won't say that right now either
what's being proposed or what

02:32:38.977 --> 02:32:41.946
you see when you go to treasure
island is the final state. But

02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:44.784
but you're saying they have a
plan that yeah, there's an

02:32:44.784 --> 02:32:47.519
ultimate. There's an ultimate
plan for treasure island that

02:32:48.587 --> 02:32:51.155
goes block by block and
describes the take you up on

02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:54.240
your suggestion. So we will we

02:32:54.260 --> 02:32:56.930
will arrange that through the
commission secretary to have a

02:32:56.428 --> 02:32:58.428
presentation on those issues.

02:32:58.697 --> 02:33:00.697
There are larger planning issues

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.834
that are happening all over the
city for other development

02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:07.172
areas. I, I think if there is
concern that when staff comes

02:33:07.306 --> 02:33:09.306
and presents the details of

02:33:09.875 --> 02:33:12.770
those planning efforts, that we
would wish to anticipate that

02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:16.147
earlier the like I said, most
planning that's happening now is

02:33:16.448 --> 02:33:18.448
considered doing this

02:33:19.886 --> 02:33:21.888
discussions such as this as part
of the planning process. But

02:33:21.888 --> 02:33:23.888
there MAY be situations where

02:33:24.570 --> 02:33:26.570
the planning started many years

02:33:26.559 --> 02:33:28.827
ago. There MAY be situations
where we have to compromise. As

02:33:29.362 --> 02:33:32.131
I know, class four facilities
are preferred in certain

02:33:32.831 --> 02:33:34.831
situations, but if a street is

02:33:35.434 --> 02:33:37.434
very minor, if a street is low

02:33:39.526 --> 02:33:40.765
volume, a class four facility
MAY not be appropriate and it

02:33:42.242 --> 02:33:44.443
MAY require additional ten feet,
20ft of right of way that could

02:33:45.778 --> 02:33:48.213
have been used for pedestrians
or for buildings. So we want to

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.216
be mindful that the planning
that's happening be done in

02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:56.255
concert with other needs. But at
the same time, keeping in mind

02:33:57.658 --> 02:34:00.459
that we want to have a safe
network. And I think the but it

02:34:01.394 --> 02:34:03.896
is an opportunity. Yes
definitely. It's not a brand new

02:34:03.997 --> 02:34:05.997
neighborhood. It's been

02:34:07.233 --> 02:34:10.202
definitely. But it's got a lot
of it's got good bones. But we

02:34:10.838 --> 02:34:12.838
haven't put the flesh on the

02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:15.410
bones yet. Yes. Any any time
that we start from scratch to

02:34:15.409 --> 02:34:17.409
some degree, it creates an

02:34:17.778 --> 02:34:19.679
opportunity to create the kind
of street network and the kind

02:34:20.414 --> 02:34:23.382
of urban environment that we
want to see in in the future.

02:34:24.785 --> 02:34:27.553
So, yes, that that I think, is
what everyone wants to achieve.

02:34:28.356 --> 02:34:30.356
Thank you, MADAM Chair. Thank

02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:35.161
you. Director henzi, please. Yes
yes, I would concur with

02:34:37.831 --> 02:34:39.831
director hemminger and wanting

02:34:43.637 --> 02:34:46.372
to take this up along with a. A
more holistic conversation

02:34:49.430 --> 02:34:51.430
around treasure island. Um, so

02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:54.980
to that end, is there a time

02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:57.490
line that you mentioned a lot of

02:34:57.985 --> 02:34:59.853
other agencies and a lot of
other moving parts here is there

02:35:02.323 --> 02:35:04.323
a timeline that we need to

02:35:04.526 --> 02:35:06.526
approve this by that we would

02:35:06.994 --> 02:35:08.994
need to approve this by or could

02:35:09.931 --> 02:35:11.931
we wait to have take this up

02:35:13.401 --> 02:35:16.102
along with the a more holistic
conversation around treasure

02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:21.308
island? Yes, good afternoon.
Bryant wu, senior traffic

02:35:23.211 --> 02:35:24.712
engineer. I understand the
discussion very closely

02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:27.281
regarding all the bicycle
facilities on treasure island

02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:31.840
and yerba buena island as far as

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.540
urgency, I would humbly request

02:35:36.891 --> 02:35:38.891
that at least item a be heard.

02:35:40.896 --> 02:35:42.896
That is the portion of mccalla

02:35:43.699 --> 02:35:45.699
road after you exit the bay

02:35:46.735 --> 02:35:48.735
bridge east bike path. Um, and I

02:35:49.905 --> 02:35:52.720
can explain what is on the
agenda specific likely to

02:35:53.175 --> 02:35:55.175
facilitate a bicycle facility

02:35:55.645 --> 02:35:58.580
fee over the next three years of
construction so that particular

02:35:59.782 --> 02:36:01.782
item I would suggest, be heard

02:36:02.585 --> 02:36:04.719
today and perhaps some of the
other items could be continued

02:36:07.656 --> 02:36:09.656
to a ladder discussion on. I

02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:13.260
think, MADAM Chair, I think

02:36:13.596 --> 02:36:16.131
that's the direction I would
like to go. But since you

02:36:16.232 --> 02:36:18.232
severed these items, I'll defer

02:36:18.935 --> 02:36:20.935
to you on on how how you would

02:36:22.772 --> 02:36:24.772
like to proceed so that the

02:36:25.908 --> 02:36:27.976
you're saying. Aye. Aye. That's
the class three. That's the

02:36:28.711 --> 02:36:30.845
share shared bike route. That's
what you'd like us to move

02:36:31.247 --> 02:36:33.247
forward today for some deadline

02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:36.151
reason. Yes that's correct.
Okay. Director tomlin. Brian,

02:36:38.488 --> 02:36:40.823
please correct me if I'm wrong,
but aren't several of these

02:36:40.823 --> 02:36:43.758
streets built or under
construction and aren't they all

02:36:44.293 --> 02:36:47.280
in an adopted developer
agreement and an adopted

02:36:47.897 --> 02:36:50.866
environmental document? I mean,
I'm wondering, does the sfmta

02:36:52.769 --> 02:36:54.769
have any ability to change the

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:58.206
design design of these streets

02:36:58.341 --> 02:37:01.243
that are already in a developer
agreement that a developer is

02:37:01.277 --> 02:37:03.946
building? Yeah. In this
particular case, yes, you're

02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:07.183
correct that the facilities are
in the developer agreement,

02:37:07.851 --> 02:37:09.851
except what was on your agenda

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:14.490
today is an interim layout for
the street until all of the

02:37:15.192 --> 02:37:17.192
ramps on both sides of the

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:19.461
islands is completed three years

02:37:19.763 --> 02:37:21.763
from now. So what you're hearing

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:26.102
before you today is an interim
condition for bikes for a

02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:28.670
bicycle facility to get the

02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.420
treasure island. And how long

02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:36.711
would that interim facility be

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:39.147
in place? Is that item aa only

02:37:39.683 --> 02:37:42.419
or is that all of these items?
Okay. Yeah, that's aa only and

02:37:43.454 --> 02:37:45.454
that would be in place for the

02:37:46.624 --> 02:37:48.624
next three years until the west

02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:50.859
side bridges is completed in

02:37:51.729 --> 02:37:54.230
2025. Okay okay. Is there a
meaningful difference to hear it

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:57.100
today versus on DECEMBER fifth
that our next meeting? Is there

02:37:57.668 --> 02:38:00.270
a reason not to continue this
item as well? To allow for more

02:38:06.177 --> 02:38:08.177
background? No okay. Any other

02:38:08.379 --> 02:38:11.314
comments or questions? Okay. Is
there a motion to continue? I

02:38:12.716 --> 02:38:14.716
would make that motion and

02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:17.789
include in it that it we're
continuing it to a meeting where

02:38:19.557 --> 02:38:21.557
we can get a briefing on the

02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:24.661
full array of bike improvements,
including the status of the

02:38:25.964 --> 02:38:28.699
developer agreement and how much
it constrains our range of

02:38:31.736 --> 02:38:34.605
motion. So okay, please call the
roll. I will just, just want to

02:38:35.741 --> 02:38:38.609
note to the directors, while
you're saying DECEMBER 5th, we

02:38:38.744 --> 02:38:40.978
are actually in full motion
already for finalizing the

02:38:41.179 --> 02:38:44.140
agenda items on that. So I'm
very reluctant to say this item

02:38:44.749 --> 02:38:46.917
can fall on that, given how
close we are to publishing for

02:38:47.786 --> 02:38:49.720
the next meeting. So the
expectation, I think

02:38:50.321 --> 02:38:52.791
realistically is that it's
actually going to be a few

02:38:53.250 --> 02:38:55.793
meetings out in order to prepare
all the materials. I just wanted

02:38:57.262 --> 02:38:59.262
to let you all know that. But

02:38:59.832 --> 02:39:02.660
there is a motion and a second.
Do you want me to call? Okay,

02:39:02.801 --> 02:39:04.801
i'll just ask my question again.

02:39:05.103 --> 02:39:07.103
Do you mean JANUARY 16th is when

02:39:07.205 --> 02:39:09.274
this would come? Potentially
JANUARY 16th also MAY be

02:39:11.344 --> 02:39:13.478
FEBRUARY meetings. I see. Okay
what's the response from staff

02:39:13.546 --> 02:39:15.546
on that timeline? With that

02:39:15.681 --> 02:39:17.681
timeline, I would request that

02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:21.886
item aa be heard today. I think
you'll be happy with what you

02:39:26.359 --> 02:39:28.359
see. Can I? I'm sorry. So these

02:39:30.463 --> 02:39:32.463
are interim strategy. I would

02:39:33.999 --> 02:39:35.999
like to see what is the ultimate

02:39:37.970 --> 02:39:40.872
final road condition. Say like
15 years from now. You know, of

02:39:42.308 --> 02:39:44.308
course, because this is really

02:39:44.677 --> 02:39:46.512
difficult, but I found myself
really challenging to see

02:39:48.810 --> 02:39:50.810
piecemeal items and not knowing

02:39:51.684 --> 02:39:53.684
what the ultimate goal, the true

02:39:54.387 --> 02:39:56.387
final intent it is. But I'm

02:39:56.756 --> 02:39:58.756
happy to see what you have today

02:39:59.659 --> 02:40:01.659
in light of the scheduled time

02:40:01.661 --> 02:40:03.661
constraint that you have. Thank

02:40:03.730 --> 02:40:05.730
you. So this is strictly for

02:40:07.701 --> 02:40:09.701
item aa and conveniently, I have

02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:12.370
some pictures if I kno

02:40:13.373 --> 02:40:15.373
display this, how do I switch to

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:19.760
the. Go ahead. Thank you so this

02:40:19.146 --> 02:40:21.146
is the class four facility as

02:40:21.215 --> 02:40:23.215
you are coming from oakland

02:40:23.751 --> 02:40:25.818
across the eastern span of the
bay bridge. And you're going

02:40:27.688 --> 02:40:29.688
through the one of two hairballs

02:40:31.858 --> 02:40:33.659
of treasure island. You're doing
multiple loop de loops and you

02:40:34.628 --> 02:40:36.628
have a two way facility and you

02:40:37.310 --> 02:40:39.320
are approaching what we call the
south gate ramp. And so the

02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:42.400
bicyclist in either direction

02:40:43.170 --> 02:40:45.170
will ride through this class

02:40:45.239 --> 02:40:48.107
four coming over the bridge. And
once you get past this point,

02:40:49.109 --> 02:40:51.109
you have to go underneath this

02:40:52.146 --> 02:40:55.810
new hair ball and we also we
have a class four facility here.

02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:58.151
There's a traffic signal that
won't be activated for three

02:40:59.387 --> 02:41:01.387
years until the west side

02:41:01.389 --> 02:41:03.389
bridges project is done in. But

02:41:03.758 --> 02:41:06.259
in the interim, we have
maintained the class four

02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.460
facility both directions as you

02:41:08.529 --> 02:41:10.529
go underneath the hair ball

02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:13.968
until you get to this all way
stop. Oh, sorry. The west the

02:41:13.968 --> 02:41:16.770
west construct action is
underway, right? Yes that's

02:41:17.638 --> 02:41:19.638
correct. It'll be completed in

02:41:21.476 --> 02:41:23.610
25. Yes that's correct. Okay. So
and at that point, you want to

02:41:25.847 --> 02:41:27.847
have the bike lane built as part

02:41:28.984 --> 02:41:31.840
of that project? Not quite as
part of that project. We're

02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:35.922
creating a second class four
facility. So what you have here

02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:40.260
today is a combination class

02:41:40.295 --> 02:41:43.230
three, class four for the
interim condition until we can

02:41:45.567 --> 02:41:47.567
get to class four everywhere.

02:41:49.204 --> 02:41:51.204
That's correct. Okay so item a

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:54.308
is class three and class four
for the next three years until

02:41:55.443 --> 02:41:57.443
we can make it 100% class 4 in

02:41:59.347 --> 02:42:01.347
2025. Got it. Okay colleagues,

02:42:02.117 --> 02:42:04.285
we have a motion and a second to
continue the item. We're being

02:42:04.854 --> 02:42:06.854
asked by staff to move a today.

02:42:06.855 --> 02:42:09.557
I will ask, is there a motion
from the board to move a today?

02:42:11.493 --> 02:42:13.528
I'll move that. I'll second,

02:42:15.631 --> 02:42:17.631

of the items on the motion to

02:42:42.250 --> 02:42:44.250
continue items 10.2 are and be

02:43:05.582 --> 02:43:08.450
That motion is approved. Okay.
And I'm just going to make a

02:43:09.218 --> 02:43:11.921
request to staff now that in the
context of the active
communities plan that we have

02:43:11.921 --> 02:43:13.921
this conversation with this

02:43:14.491 --> 02:43:17.226
board well in advance of the
final adoption of the plan on

02:43:18.462 --> 02:43:20.696
how safe is safe enough and is
there a minimum safety threshold

02:43:21.431 --> 02:43:23.565
of bicycle bicycle facilities
that this board wants included

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:26.502
in that plan? On to the
discussion. We've had today. I

02:43:28.104 --> 02:43:30.205
would love to have that
conversation. And again, I want

02:43:30.441 --> 02:43:33.376
to also have the conversation
about to what degree should we

02:43:35.112 --> 02:43:37.112
be moving fast with with less

02:43:37.214 --> 02:43:39.348
than perfect materials versus
moving very slow with perfect

02:43:39.650 --> 02:43:42.118
materials, given our staffing
and our capital resource

02:43:43.287 --> 02:43:45.287
constraints? Understand. Okay,

02:43:46.289 --> 02:43:48.289
great. Please call item 11. Very

02:43:49.227 --> 02:43:51.961
good directors places you on
your regular calendar for item

02:43:52.596 --> 02:43:54.596
number 11 approving the sfmta's

02:43:58.435 --> 02:44:00.435
2024 legislative program. Good

02:44:01.238 --> 02:44:03.238
afternoon, chair. Ekin directors

02:44:04.641 --> 02:44:06.641
director tumlin. We are here

02:44:06.878 --> 02:44:08.745
today for your for your
consideration with a

02:44:10.881 --> 02:44:12.949
presentation on the proposed
2024 legislative program. We

02:44:13.170 --> 02:44:15.170
come to you every year around

02:44:15.653 --> 02:44:17.653
this time with an overview of

02:44:17.788 --> 02:44:19.788
our local, state and federal

02:44:19.957 --> 02:44:21.957
priorities as also noting our

02:44:22.794 --> 02:44:24.794
regulatory affairs role. This

02:44:24.963 --> 02:44:27.131
year, our program was informed
at your request last year for

02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:31.680
some earlier conversations with
those of you who asked for that

02:44:31.669 --> 02:44:33.771
and had the opportunity to get
some of your input into this

02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:38.242
process. You know, one of the
observations I would make about

02:44:38.242 --> 02:44:40.242
this year, particularly in

02:44:40.412 --> 02:44:42.613
sacramento, we're going into a
second year of the current two

02:44:42.881 --> 02:44:44.881
year session, is very dynamic

02:44:44.983 --> 02:44:47.718
election year, a lot of a lot of
things are still in flux. But I

02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:50.988
think that we're clear in making
recommendation to you today

02:44:51.256 --> 02:44:53.824
about where we see the emphasis
and the priorities being in the

02:44:54.125 --> 02:44:56.794
coming year. And so the team
will give you an overview of

02:44:57.796 --> 02:44:59.796
that. This this program was also

02:45:00.632 --> 02:45:02.632
presented, presented to the cac

02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:06.770
on OCTOBER 5th. And they had an

02:45:06.805 --> 02:45:08.806
opportunity to discuss and
consider the priorities and

02:45:09.407 --> 02:45:11.842
approved the recommended set of
priorities that you'll see here

02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:18.150
today. Yeah, I talked about that

02:45:19.151 --> 02:45:21.821
. So today I'm going to start
and introduce monique webster,

02:45:21.821 --> 02:45:24.322
who is our regional government
affairs manager, and she will go

02:45:25.657 --> 02:45:27.825
over sort of a quick high level
of what we accomplished in the

02:45:29.161 --> 02:45:31.797
past year and then look forward
to 2024. And then joel ramos,

02:45:31.797 --> 02:45:34.433
our local government affairs
manager, will present a high

02:45:36.168 --> 02:45:38.168
level on local and then we have

02:45:38.237 --> 02:45:40.138
a closing slide on our
regulatory affairs oversight.

02:45:49.615 --> 02:45:51.615
Thank you.

02:45:51.884 --> 02:45:53.884
There we go. Hi, good afternoon.

02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:56.155
I'm monique webster, manager of
regional government affairs with

02:45:57.123 --> 02:45:59.123
sfmta. And I'm going to start

02:45:59.425 --> 02:46:01.493
out with highlighting some of
our state and federal successes

02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:05.290
from this past year. So first, I

02:46:05.798 --> 02:46:08.990
wanted to share with you that
our team was fully engaged in

02:46:08.335 --> 02:46:11.103
making the case for transit
operations funding to avert the

02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:14.106
fiscal cliff that we and many
other operators faced. This was

02:46:15.408 --> 02:46:17.408
really our number one priority

02:46:17.911 --> 02:46:20.112
at and as part of a statewide
coalition, we secured a

02:46:20.813 --> 02:46:22.813
commitment in the state budget

02:46:22.949 --> 02:46:25.917
to not only retain $2 billion
for transit capital projects

02:46:26.753 --> 02:46:28.753
that were in danger of being cut

02:46:29.223 --> 02:46:31.424
out, but also an additional $1
billion that could be used over

02:46:32.392 --> 02:46:34.392
the next four years for transit

02:46:35.195 --> 02:46:37.196
operating needs. Another notable
outcome was the successful

02:46:38.265 --> 02:46:40.966
enactment of ab 645, which we
already touched on during the

02:46:41.267 --> 02:46:43.267
director's report today that

02:46:43.304 --> 02:46:45.304
authorizes the use of speed

02:46:45.306 --> 02:46:48.241
safety cameras for the in san
francisco and five other cities.

02:46:50.577 --> 02:46:52.577
This year. We also saw passage

02:46:52.613 --> 02:46:54.814
of ab 361 authored by assembly
member ward that permits the use

02:46:55.315 --> 02:46:58.170
of cameras on city owned
vehicles in order to enforce

02:46:59.285 --> 02:47:01.285
force parking, restrict fines

02:47:01.589 --> 02:47:03.589
and in bike lanes. Another

02:47:04.580 --> 02:47:06.526
notable outcome is that the
state legislature acted to place

02:47:09.231 --> 02:47:11.231
a constitution amendment aca one

02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.734
on the NOVEMBER 2024 ballot and
if that is successful, it will

02:47:15.502 --> 02:47:17.502
lower the voter threshold from

02:47:17.539 --> 02:47:19.573
two thirds to 55% for state and
local tax increases that fund

02:47:20.708 --> 02:47:23.478
affordable housing and public
infrastructure. Importantly

02:47:23.478 --> 02:47:26.146
including public transit capital
projects. Finally, we secured

02:47:26.847 --> 02:47:29.783
state funding for several
important safety and resilience

02:47:29.784 --> 02:47:32.118
projects listed here through
both the budget process and

02:47:33.154 --> 02:47:35.755
competitive grant programs. And
then turning to the federal

02:47:36.825 --> 02:47:39.627
side, our team worked to secure
the political support needed to

02:47:40.261 --> 02:47:42.363
successfully win funding across
a number of competitive grant

02:47:43.698 --> 02:47:46.433
programs. The largest was a $30
million award for the woods and

02:47:47.368 --> 02:47:49.368
creek bus maintenance facilities

02:47:53.909 --> 02:47:56.143
. As. So looking ahead to 2024
for our state legislative

02:47:57.913 --> 02:48:00.147
priorities, this is the second
year, as kate had mentioned, of

02:48:00.215 --> 02:48:02.215
the state legislative session

02:48:02.817 --> 02:48:05.753
that will be reconvening on
JANUARY 3rd and transit
operations funding will once

02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.688
again be our number one
priority. And there will be a

02:48:09.557 --> 02:48:11.260
number of things taking place in
that arena, including

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:13.194
legislation that will give the
metropolia transportation

02:48:14.263 --> 02:48:17.198
commission the authority to
place a regional revenue measure

02:48:19.101 --> 02:48:21.802
on the 2026 ballot and ensuring
that hard won commitments made

02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:24.370
as part of this year's state

02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:27.541
budget agreement are also upheld
. Making our streets safer and

02:48:27.577 --> 02:48:29.577
reducing traffic injuries and

02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:32.914
deaths remains a top priority to
that end, we'll continue to

02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:35.483
defend our gains and support
efforts that encourage traffic

02:48:36.819 --> 02:48:39.454
safety on parking, we will
support and coordinate advocacy

02:48:39.455 --> 02:48:41.923
efforts with public parking
interest groups, other cities

02:48:42.624 --> 02:48:44.624
and stakeholders on efforts to

02:48:44.729 --> 02:48:46.595
make paying for parking easier
and utilizing city resources

02:48:47.196 --> 02:48:49.196
more efficiently. And finally,

02:48:49.732 --> 02:48:51.732
as this board knows, avs are

02:48:52.168 --> 02:48:54.369
very dynamic area right now with
a lot of interest from state

02:48:55.371 --> 02:48:58.600
lawmakers. We don't know what
legislative proposals MAY come

02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:00.240
out at this time, but we have

02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:03.211
put this as a priority to watch,
engage in and take positions as

02:49:06.490 --> 02:49:08.490
appropriate. So now turning to

02:49:09.852 --> 02:49:12.687
the federal side for 2024, it
again unlikely that we're going

02:49:12.888 --> 02:49:14.888
to see any movement on big

02:49:15.625 --> 02:49:17.759
pieces of legislation or policy
in this year. Given the split

02:49:19.595 --> 02:49:22.465
congress. But in 2024, our focus
will be to continue to leverage

02:49:23.433 --> 02:49:25.468
opportunity his coming out of
the bipartisan infrastructure

02:49:26.569 --> 02:49:29.338
bill and also other federal
grant programs, plus working

02:49:29.439 --> 02:49:31.540
with the mayor's office to
advance community project

02:49:32.608 --> 02:49:34.743
requests to our delegation.
Soon, we'll also be keeping a

02:49:35.611 --> 02:49:38.130
close eye on other policy
priority areas listed on this

02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.160
slide and that concludes the

02:49:41.185 --> 02:49:44.860
state and federal piece. And
I'll now turn it over to joel

02:49:44.354 --> 02:49:46.354
ramos, who will cover our local

02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:52.260
priorities and legislate action.

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:56.300
Good good afternoon, chair eken

02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:58.870
directors direct. Tumlin joel

02:49:59.503 --> 02:50:01.571
ramos from the local government
affairs team working under our

02:50:04.207 --> 02:50:06.207
esteemed director kate breen.

02:50:06.544 --> 02:50:09.245
All of my efforts are support by
my colleague janet martinson,

02:50:10.547 --> 02:50:12.547
who had to leave today to get to

02:50:12.584 --> 02:50:14.584
some family obligations. But

02:50:14.819 --> 02:50:17.453
she's really responsible in huge
part for a lot of the

02:50:19.257 --> 02:50:22.158
legislation that we see coming
through the agency for the board

02:50:24.461 --> 02:50:26.461
of supervisors. My particular

02:50:26.897 --> 02:50:29.199
role also serves in overseeing
the legislative side as well as

02:50:29.199 --> 02:50:31.835
responding to constituents
inquiries and requests

02:50:32.437 --> 02:50:34.571
pertaining to the board of
supervisors or in response to

02:50:34.706 --> 02:50:37.341
the board of supervisors hours
and as director breen had

02:50:38.443 --> 02:50:40.443
mentioned earlier, that work is

02:50:40.778 --> 02:50:42.778
largely overseen by my colleague

02:50:43.470 --> 02:50:45.470
chadwick lee, who also had to

02:50:45.490 --> 02:50:47.490
leave to get back to that. That

02:50:47.118 --> 02:50:49.118
very work, our work, as you

02:50:49.387 --> 02:50:52.890
probably all well know, is
mostly around just making sure

02:50:55.174 --> 02:50:56.601
that this agency has the
legislation it needs from the
board of supervisors. And so

02:50:57.462 --> 02:50:59.462
there's a number of legislation

02:50:59.497 --> 02:51:02.466
that does have to go to them,
particularly with regard to

02:51:05.971 --> 02:51:07.971
legislation that is very high in

02:51:08.707 --> 02:51:10.707
cost, like over $10 million and

02:51:13.246 --> 02:51:15.246
or has contract lengths that are

02:51:15.347 --> 02:51:17.548
over ten years. So there's a
number of pieces of legislation

02:51:18.917 --> 02:51:21.352
that go through there all the
time. And then of course, I'm

02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:24.870
also keeping them apprized of

02:51:24.957 --> 02:51:27.125
various policy debates or even
I've had the pleasure of talking

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:30.428
with some of them regarding some
of your appointments. It's all

02:51:31.296 --> 02:51:33.397
part of the work that the local
government affairs team does.

02:51:33.632 --> 02:51:36.601
Some of the most probably the
most important stuff that stands

02:51:37.502 --> 02:51:39.502
out to me from last year's work

02:51:39.939 --> 02:51:42.274
was getting the central subway
architectural engineering

02:51:43.576 --> 02:51:45.110
services surface segment,
trackway systems, quality

02:51:45.745 --> 02:51:48.713
control and design integration
contracts approved through the

02:51:49.348 --> 02:51:51.348
board of supervisors. That was

02:51:51.350 --> 02:51:54.285
the work that would need to be
putting the finishing touches on

02:51:55.154 --> 02:51:57.388
the central subway. It was a big
deal because it was a pretty big

02:51:58.725 --> 02:52:00.959
amount. And people thought that
it was, you know, over and done

02:52:01.894 --> 02:52:04.329
with. But we of course, needed
to get this through the board of

02:52:04.397 --> 02:52:06.397
supervisors to keep going with

02:52:06.599 --> 02:52:09.434
that work. Looking ahead, we are
planning on continuing to work

02:52:09.635 --> 02:52:12.437
with them. Some of the major
items that I'm working with,

02:52:12.971 --> 02:52:15.273
director kirschbaum and her team
on are like the automatic train

02:52:15.942 --> 02:52:18.677
control system communications
based train control systems,

02:52:19.546 --> 02:52:21.546
procurements for new the new

02:52:22.415 --> 02:52:24.650
busses is going to be needing
their authority fauci their

02:52:26.386 --> 02:52:28.553
approval. And then there's a
number of things related to like

02:52:29.288 --> 02:52:31.288
the yards and the building

02:52:33.227 --> 02:52:36.280
progress. All of that work will
be here for them and, and

02:52:36.330 --> 02:52:39.131
assisting the agency in making
sure that everybody has what

02:52:39.966 --> 02:52:42.401
they need to be informed on
these matters. Sometimes there's

02:52:44.471 --> 02:52:46.471
ballot measures that come up

02:52:46.773 --> 02:52:48.874
that we all need to be on the
same page around. There was a

02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:51.878
recent charter amendment
proposed. This is the kind of

02:52:52.146 --> 02:52:55.140
work that we are doing all the
time that it is keeping

02:52:55.382 --> 02:52:57.382
everybody apprized of what each

02:52:57.684 --> 02:53:00.420
of the entities are doing,
whether it's the local, the mta

02:53:01.654 --> 02:53:03.654
or the board of supervisors. I

02:53:05.358 --> 02:53:07.526
can speak at any of these on any
of these issues. Probably the

02:53:08.696 --> 02:53:10.696
things that I would point out

02:53:11.165 --> 02:53:14.133
are most important. Well,
they're all very important, but

02:53:15.302 --> 02:53:17.302
so I'm not going to call out any

02:53:18.238 --> 02:53:20.306
one of them. I would just note
that thanks to director breen

02:53:20.674 --> 02:53:23.509
and her good efforts, we've got
the speed safety camera
implementation that's going to

02:53:23.844 --> 02:53:26.613
take some work and actually
locating it and getting all the

02:53:27.282 --> 02:53:29.383
authorization that we need to
implement it. I think that's

02:53:29.484 --> 02:53:32.419
going to be a real exciting one
over the year and then of

02:53:33.187 --> 02:53:35.288
course, we've got director
torrance still here. She's not

02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:39.910
here. Oh, sorry. Yes, of course.

02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:43.940
Yep. And director. For let's see

02:53:44.866 --> 02:53:47.634
here. Yes yes, this one. Oh
moussa was not working. Yes.

02:53:50.371 --> 02:53:52.806
Sorry. And then I was going to
say director torin also, of

02:53:53.641 --> 02:53:55.809
course, has a lot of things that
are happening with av taxi

02:53:56.911 --> 02:53:59.145
mobility related things. So I
feel like I'm always talking

02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:01.480
with the board of supervisors

02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:03.590
about whether it's scooters or

02:54:04.719 --> 02:54:06.854
autonomous vehicles or our taxi
programs. There's just a lot of

02:54:06.922 --> 02:54:09.623
engagement that we're always
doing with the board of

02:54:09.758 --> 02:54:12.659
supervisors that we're here for.
So I know it's been a long

02:54:13.461 --> 02:54:15.529
afternoon, so I'm going to keep
this brief. I'm going to turn

02:54:15.663 --> 02:54:18.366
this over to my esteemed
colleague, kathleen salas, to

02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:21.402
talk about the regulatory
affairs and making sure that

02:54:22.371 --> 02:54:24.371
we're all in compliance. Thank

02:54:28.143 --> 02:54:30.143
you. Yes I think it's here.

02:54:30.578 --> 02:54:32.781
Perfect. Good afternoon, chair
egan and members of the board,

02:54:32.781 --> 02:54:34.781
kathleen salas, regulatory

02:54:35.184 --> 02:54:37.184
affairs manager here today to

02:54:37.186 --> 02:54:39.554
talk about our state and federal
rulemaking opportunity, which I

02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:44.192
like to call ledge program
adjacent. The rule makings are

02:54:45.270 --> 02:54:46.994
the public process by which we
really have an opportunity to

02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:50.131
shape the rules and regulations
that govern so many aspects of

02:54:51.867 --> 02:54:53.969
our agency. We have staff. Kathy
broussard is an excellent job.

02:54:54.704 --> 02:54:56.705
And you heard from her earlier
during public comment for kate,

02:54:57.907 --> 02:55:00.410
but she helps identify the
opportunities and then we send

02:55:00.743 --> 02:55:02.743
them out to the subject matter

02:55:03.112 --> 02:55:05.112
experts monitor the process, the

02:55:05.147 --> 02:55:07.215
process, collect feedback and
determine whether or not we're

02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:09.884
going to actually public
publicly comment on something at

02:55:11.221 --> 02:55:13.221
the state level. So the

02:55:13.356 --> 02:55:15.891
california administration
procedures act provides an

02:55:15.992 --> 02:55:18.326
opportunity to help us shape
those regulations that have the

02:55:19.128 --> 02:55:21.696
force of law by the california
state agencies. So some sample

02:55:22.999 --> 02:55:25.000
agencies that we participate in
the rulemaking are the

02:55:25.434 --> 02:55:27.434
california air resources board,

02:55:28.238 --> 02:55:31.106
cal osha, the cpuc, and the
department of motor vehicles at

02:55:31.475 --> 02:55:33.909
the federal level, the
rulemaking is the policy making

02:55:34.811 --> 02:55:37.579
process that the federal
government uses to develop and

02:55:39.849 --> 02:55:41.784
to develop an issue new rules
and regulations. But they also

02:55:42.986 --> 02:55:45.621
use it to amend and repeal and
repeal an existing rule when

02:55:46.356 --> 02:55:48.356
they need to. So some sample

02:55:49.826 --> 02:55:51.260
agencies are dot fta, nhtsa and
the federal highways

02:55:53.930 --> 02:55:55.965
administered ation. So recent or
current rulemaking topics that

02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:58.901
we're working on right now are
transit worker safety, some nepa

02:55:59.869 --> 02:56:02.737
issues, amending accessibility
requirements for transportation

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:05.340
facilities, state safety

02:56:05.442 --> 02:56:07.442
oversight, regulation on zero

02:56:07.878 --> 02:56:09.979
emission forklift rule, other
things that are associated with

02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:13.480
carb and our public transport

02:56:13.150 --> 02:56:15.251
safety certification, training
program. So I'm happy to go into

02:56:15.686 --> 02:56:18.870
more detail on anything or
answer any questions, but thank

02:56:20.525 --> 02:56:22.525
you for your time. I conclude

02:56:23.270 --> 02:56:25.729
the presentation. Yeah, that is
the presentation and we're happy

02:56:28.365 --> 02:56:29.866
to answer questions. As you wish
, colleagues. Are there

02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:33.680
questions for the gov affairs

02:56:34.672 --> 02:56:36.672
team? Director henderson. Yes,

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:40.900
I'm curious. As I heard the word

02:56:40.478 --> 02:56:42.713
nepa and so I'm curious what on
nepa you all are responding to

02:56:46.384 --> 02:56:48.384
now. So we've been engaging with

02:56:48.519 --> 02:56:50.320
dot. I mean, the realm of
environmental project

02:56:50.588 --> 02:56:53.390
streamlining environmental
reform has been something that

02:56:54.493 --> 02:56:56.493
we've been focused on for a

02:56:56.595 --> 02:56:59.363
number of years. There have been
there has been incremental

02:56:59.464 --> 02:57:01.464
progress at the federal level

02:57:02.467 --> 02:57:04.535
around how the fact that states
like california have the

02:57:05.236 --> 02:57:06.903
california environmental quality
act sequa and the federal

02:57:07.772 --> 02:57:10.374
national environmental
protection act often are

02:57:11.509 --> 02:57:13.509
redundant. And so our efforts

02:57:14.266 --> 02:57:16.313
have really been focused at
digging in. And the
administration actually in

02:57:17.415 --> 02:57:20.317
coming to california and
implementing the infrastructure

02:57:21.556 --> 02:57:23.754
investment and jobs act came to
us and asked specifically if we

02:57:23.955 --> 02:57:26.557
had recommendations, options on
how nepa and federal

02:57:27.992 --> 02:57:29.992
environmental review could be

02:57:30.562 --> 02:57:32.330
streamlined and that has to do
with, again, ensuring that

02:57:33.198 --> 02:57:35.299
california's review and approval
counts, that you don't have to

02:57:36.535 --> 02:57:38.703
do it a second time. If the
threshold is met in terms of

02:57:40.505 --> 02:57:42.539
environmental law and something
that director tumlin has thought

02:57:43.475 --> 02:57:45.676
a lot about, and if there are
other things that you would want

02:57:47.179 --> 02:57:50.115
to add to that, but it's an
ongoing effort, I'd say that we

02:57:50.349 --> 02:57:53.118
continue to look for when the
interest is, is there, as it has

02:57:53.319 --> 02:57:55.553
been with this administration
action, including both the
gubernatorial administration

02:57:56.455 --> 02:57:58.856
here in california, but also the
federal administration. And do

02:58:01.593 --> 02:58:03.728
you feel like progress is being
made there? Because I know I

02:58:04.764 --> 02:58:06.764
mean, I know it's nepa and it's

02:58:06.866 --> 02:58:09.000
big, but I just wonder, do you
think that in incremental is

02:58:10.603 --> 02:58:12.603
real progress or is it just sort

02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:17.375
of I mean, I, I think so. But
jeff, I really would look to you

02:58:18.244 --> 02:58:21.450
if you had some insight because
he's been really leading in this

02:58:21.213 --> 02:58:23.213
space, too. Yeah, we're right

02:58:23.316 --> 02:58:25.317
now we're focused on administrar
rule change rather than

02:58:25.785 --> 02:58:28.420
legislative change. And
fortunately, the buttigieg

02:58:29.255 --> 02:58:31.356
administration has been quite
interested in trying to figure

02:58:32.625 --> 02:58:35.560
out what can we do within the
context of the statute in order

02:58:36.562 --> 02:58:38.562
to get out of the way of good

02:58:38.564 --> 02:58:41.330
projects. And hopefully I will
be traveling to washington in

02:58:42.436 --> 02:58:44.603
JANUARY in order to continue
some of that work. Got it. Thank

02:58:45.905 --> 02:58:47.905
you. Thank you for the question.

02:58:49.209 --> 02:58:51.209
DR. Heminger. Thank you, MADAM

02:58:52.679 --> 02:58:55.414
Chair. To subjects kate and jeff
may want to chime in on this

02:58:56.215 --> 02:58:58.215
first one. Automated vehicles

02:58:58.852 --> 02:59:00.852
and the statement in your

02:59:01.822 --> 02:59:03.822
program is, is pretty broad. Yes

02:59:03.823 --> 02:59:06.692
and I wonder whether the program
would benefit from greater

02:59:08.610 --> 02:59:10.629
specificity. You know, on the
one side of the spectrum is how

02:59:11.831 --> 02:59:14.633
I would characterize where we
are now, where we send strong

02:59:15.536 --> 02:59:17.536
letters into the state and they

02:59:17.805 --> 02:59:19.973
pat us on the head and say,
thank you very much for your

02:59:20.841 --> 02:59:23.576
ideas. At the other end would be
giving hundreds of cities in

02:59:25.780 --> 02:59:27.780
california veto power over who

02:59:27.581 --> 02:59:29.581
gets to drive on their streets.

02:59:30.684 --> 02:59:32.684
So where in that spectrum do we

02:59:32.687 --> 02:59:34.687
want to fall? I mean, where do

02:59:35.222 --> 02:59:37.222
we want to get to? Well, I'm

02:59:38.159 --> 02:59:39.693
just going to tee up, jeff, by
saying that the space is

02:59:40.427 --> 02:59:42.427
incredibly dynamic. We know

02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:45.531
compared to a year ago, we are
seeing legislators as super lean

02:59:47.534 --> 02:59:50.203
in on this. We have senator
cortese, who has asked for a

02:59:51.706 --> 02:59:54.408
study. We have mayor bass, who's
gone on record along with mayor
breed, making the case for

02:59:56.177 --> 02:59:58.177
cities interest in having access

02:59:58.246 --> 03:00:01.470
to data. And so I would expect
that we will see something play

03:00:02.249 --> 03:00:05.850
out. I don't know if we can
predict what that is, but yes,

03:00:06.921 --> 03:00:09.890
and I can say just a little bit
more on this topic where we're

03:00:10.910 --> 03:00:12.910
engaged across several different

03:00:13.261 --> 03:00:15.929
departments and with both the
executive and the legislative

03:00:16.731 --> 03:00:18.731
branch of government on four

03:00:20.668 --> 03:00:22.668
parallel paths. One is a path

03:00:23.103 --> 03:00:25.206
aimed at our regulators the most
, the state regulators, but also

03:00:25.908 --> 03:00:28.609
nhtsa at the at the federal
level. The second is a legal

03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:38.180
path, a third is a. What really
we think is the best path to

03:00:39.220 --> 03:00:41.220
support the advancement of the

03:00:41.222 --> 03:00:43.791
industry, while also upholding
the public good, which is a more

03:00:44.493 --> 03:00:46.493
collaborative negotiated path.

03:00:50.599 --> 03:00:53.670
And. A legal what's the fourth
one that I'm now missing?

03:00:54.690 --> 03:00:56.370
Legislative. Oh, and of course
the legislative path. Yeah.

03:00:58.673 --> 03:01:00.673
Which we which is an important

03:01:01.143 --> 03:01:03.144
part. But we also want to make
sure that if any legislation

03:01:03.479 --> 03:01:05.479
does pass that it doesn't

03:01:05.915 --> 03:01:07.915
unintentionally incur for us.

03:01:07.983 --> 03:01:09.983
Right? So really what we're

03:01:10.252 --> 03:01:12.252
trying to get is industry to the

03:01:13.388 --> 03:01:15.388
table in order to define a clear

03:01:15.390 --> 03:01:17.390
set of public, good oriented

03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:19.860
outcomes as along with

03:01:20.530 --> 03:01:22.530
performance metrics and data to

03:01:24.233 --> 03:01:27.350
support that so that. 911 calls
and twitter aren't our primary

03:01:27.870 --> 03:01:30.605
source of performance data for
the industry. And we believe

03:01:31.674 --> 03:01:34.542
that is that level of
collaboration and transparency

03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:38.790
is what best supports the

03:01:38.214 --> 03:01:40.214
advancement of industry, as well

03:01:40.750 --> 03:01:42.551
as making sure that we have the
tools that we've got in order to

03:01:43.453 --> 03:01:45.453
make sure that our streets still

03:01:47.156 --> 03:01:49.156
work. Okay the second one is

03:01:49.825 --> 03:01:51.825
about these numbers. It's in one

03:01:51.828 --> 03:01:53.828
of the items in the report about

03:01:54.531 --> 03:01:56.531
the contract limits we have with

03:01:58.100 --> 03:02:00.100
the board of supervisors. And I

03:02:00.370 --> 03:02:02.370
believe it's ten years or 10

03:02:02.572 --> 03:02:04.572
million bucks. Did that

03:02:06.409 --> 03:02:08.409
originate with our origination

03:02:09.913 --> 03:02:12.615
as an agency? 20 years ago? I
can answer that if you want. No,

03:02:17.521 --> 03:02:19.588
sorry. The those limits are
citywide and they're in the

03:02:20.657 --> 03:02:22.657
charter for its section 9.118.

03:02:24.460 --> 03:02:25.961
And it requires all contracts
except for construction

03:02:27.798 --> 03:02:29.798
contracts. Contracts greater

03:02:30.100 --> 03:02:32.869
than ten years or $10 million to
be approved by the board of

03:02:32.903 --> 03:02:35.672
supervisors. So it applies to
all agencies, not just ours. It

03:02:36.807 --> 03:02:38.808
applies to all agencies include
yours and specifically in

03:02:39.843 --> 03:02:41.843
proposition an, a that expanded

03:02:42.879 --> 03:02:44.879
the authority of the sfmta and

03:02:45.182 --> 03:02:47.182
its board. It specifically

03:02:47.452 --> 03:02:49.452
carved out 9.118 as something

03:02:51.789 --> 03:02:54.524
that the sfmta is still some
object to. Well, that could be a

03:02:56.327 --> 03:02:58.327
legislative item. I mean, do we

03:02:58.963 --> 03:03:00.963
find those numbers and those

03:03:01.165 --> 03:03:03.165
limits inhibiting. I know. Look,

03:03:04.135 --> 03:03:05.702
whenever you go to the board of
supervisors, they have the

03:03:06.773 --> 03:03:08.773
chance to say no or to say do

03:03:10.141 --> 03:03:12.141
this instead. Yeah, I would

03:03:12.410 --> 03:03:14.410
argue that there are many

03:03:14.445 --> 03:03:16.980
factors that are far more
important that get in the way of

03:03:18.582 --> 03:03:20.582
our good action and it would be

03:03:20.852 --> 03:03:23.870
quite interesting to have a
whole session on what are the

03:03:24.923 --> 03:03:27.291
obstacles that stand in the way
of our ability to deliver what

03:03:29.194 --> 03:03:31.194
you want. Most of the obstacles

03:03:32.430 --> 03:03:34.565
that we face for the delivery of
the clear values that you all

03:03:35.733 --> 03:03:37.733
hold and that I share those

03:03:38.103 --> 03:03:40.471
obstacles are outside the agency
and I would be happy to have a

03:03:42.700 --> 03:03:44.175
session enumerating each of them
, as well as what potential

03:03:45.243 --> 03:03:47.478
strategies there might be in
order to remove them as well.

03:03:49.447 --> 03:03:52.116
And I know just from my own
personal memory with potrero and

03:03:54.186 --> 03:03:56.186
now with the train control thing

03:03:56.221 --> 03:03:58.856
, you know, our staff is
building schedules around the

03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:01.240
fact of when the board of

03:04:02.494 --> 03:04:04.494
supervisors was has an election

03:04:05.263 --> 03:04:07.263
on and that's not the best way

03:04:08.133 --> 03:04:10.133
to run a railroad. So look I'd

03:04:10.302 --> 03:04:12.302
be willing to take you up on

03:04:12.505 --> 03:04:14.505
what you suggested about things

03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:18.710
outside of mta control if we've
got a chance of making a

03:04:22.915 --> 03:04:24.915
difference on changing them.

03:04:25.217 --> 03:04:27.652
Thank you, MADAM Chair. Thank
you, director kahina, please.

03:04:28.654 --> 03:04:30.654
Yes. Thank you so much for your

03:04:30.957 --> 03:04:32.957
presentation. I did have a

03:04:34.193 --> 03:04:36.193
question about fares

03:04:38.631 --> 03:04:41.399
specifically free muni for youth
as we're approaching the new

03:04:42.768 --> 03:04:44.768
budget season, I anticipate that

03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:46.870
fares and pricing is that's

03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:49.742
going to be a factor that comes
up for us. So curious on the

03:04:51.711 --> 03:04:53.945
state level, I believe at a
previous briefing I had with the

03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:58.150
team, you all mentioned, I think

03:04:59.180 --> 03:05:01.860
it was ab 19, 19 or 1 of those,
there was another one this year

03:05:02.288 --> 03:05:04.756
to 1802, withholding,
withholding. Holden continues to

03:05:05.625 --> 03:05:07.625
come back and try, but so far

03:05:08.395 --> 03:05:10.496
but let me correct your
question. So exactly. I was

03:05:12.132 --> 03:05:14.801
going to ask you if you could
just let members of the public

03:05:14.801 --> 03:05:17.436
know and also us like a brief,
like just description of what

03:05:18.972 --> 03:05:20.872
the appetite is, right now in
the state to support that type

03:05:21.908 --> 03:05:23.908
of support for transit agencies

03:05:24.411 --> 03:05:26.411
to offer that that resource for

03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:30.116
community members is where some
of the blockages that you're

03:05:30.117 --> 03:05:32.551
seeing. Is there anything that
we could do perhaps to our

03:05:32.686 --> 03:05:35.521
people power to leverage to
support something like that? You

03:05:36.856 --> 03:05:39.758
know, I mean, my reflection and
I don't have jeff or monique

03:05:39.794 --> 03:05:41.794
would want to add something is

03:05:41.796 --> 03:05:43.796
that it falls within that larger

03:05:43.898 --> 03:05:45.898
conversation about transit

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
agencies going over the fiscal

03:05:49.403 --> 03:05:52.104
cliff. Right? And so we have
relied on a huge coalition of

03:05:52.372 --> 03:05:55.141
partners, including partners
from community based groups that

03:05:55.575 --> 03:05:57.575
have supported free transit for

03:05:57.578 --> 03:05:59.578
youth free transit in different

03:06:00.114 --> 03:06:03.830
forms, but that that tension is
still there. Right. And so if we

03:06:03.550 --> 03:06:05.550
can't identify ongoing,

03:06:05.686 --> 03:06:08.321
permanent, stable, predictable
sources of revenue to support

03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:11.290
transit operations, it becomes a

03:06:11.358 --> 03:06:13.358
trade off exercise. And whether

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:16.230
you're going to fund programs
like that through reductions in

03:06:19.133 --> 03:06:21.335
service or make other changes
that are going to impact what

03:06:22.690 --> 03:06:23.770
you're putting out on the
street, that is the service that

03:06:24.639 --> 03:06:27.240
people rely on. That is the
dynamic of that conversation. It

03:06:29.276 --> 03:06:31.276
hasn't led to, I would say, in a

03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.281
positive way. It hasn't led to a
splintering within the coalition

03:06:35.817 --> 03:06:37.817
that can continue to advocate

03:06:38.530 --> 03:06:40.187
for public transit in general
and in particular for transit

03:06:41.356 --> 03:06:43.356
operations funding. I think it's

03:06:43.658 --> 03:06:46.426
also really important to remind
ourselves that going into the

03:06:46.627 --> 03:06:48.627
second year in sacramento, we

03:06:49.300 --> 03:06:51.632
are not guaranteed need. What
was promised to us in last

03:06:52.935 --> 03:06:54.935
year's budget. That is what

03:06:55.137 --> 03:06:57.137
we're talking about as saving us

03:06:57.205 --> 03:06:59.205
and giving us a longer runway.

03:06:59.307 --> 03:07:01.508
We still have to fight in the
face of an increasing state

03:07:02.277 --> 03:07:04.277
level deficit to keep those

03:07:04.946 --> 03:07:06.946
funds that were already acted

03:07:07.116 --> 03:07:09.284
upon last year but have to be
reacted upon in this year's

03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:14.222
budget. Right. So you know, I
think assembly member holden

03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:17.590
will take another pass at it. I

03:07:18.794 --> 03:07:21.595
don't think he's giving up and
within the context of the
california transit association,

03:07:22.797 --> 03:07:24.797
there is interest out there. But

03:07:25.635 --> 03:07:27.769
I think you would see a dynamic
that is coming more from the

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:30.904
budget perspective than it is

03:07:31.730 --> 03:07:33.730
necessarily from from the policy

03:07:34.430 --> 03:07:36.510
perspective of, of free transit
is a good thing. Jeff, please.

03:07:39.848 --> 03:07:41.849
Yeah and I would add to that,
one of the strategic things that

03:07:42.485 --> 03:07:44.953
we're trying to do is to set up
the conditions for expand the

03:07:45.621 --> 03:07:47.621
tent as big as we can get it in

03:07:47.924 --> 03:07:49.924
order to fight for our stronger

03:07:50.359 --> 03:07:52.359
state support for transit, just

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:54.361
as has already happened in new

03:07:54.897 --> 03:07:56.897
york. And so whether it is our

03:07:56.999 --> 03:07:58.999
free transit free muni program

03:07:59.603 --> 03:08:01.603
or our advocacy for bay pass

03:08:02.105 --> 03:08:04.873
through clipper, our advocacy
for clipper 2.0 and the tools

03:08:04.874 --> 03:08:06.874
that that offers and our

03:08:06.976 --> 03:08:08.510
advocacy for the california
integrated transportation

03:08:10.513 --> 03:08:12.800
program pilot, which will
dramatically streamline our

03:08:14.250 --> 03:08:16.250
ability to means test everything

03:08:16.353 --> 03:08:18.353
. We're trying to put the tools

03:08:18.822 --> 03:08:20.822
in place that invite more and

03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:23.926
more and more people into the
tent to acknowledge that transit

03:08:25.328 --> 03:08:27.328
is essential tool and it has to

03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:30.165
be funded. And in any normal
country around the world, it

03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:33.340
would be funded largely by the

03:08:33.938 --> 03:08:36.572
state and federal governments.
Yeah. So if holding does

03:08:37.674 --> 03:08:40.543
succeed, are there local levers
that we could start pulling to

03:08:42.246 --> 03:08:44.113
figure out a way to support that
program? So I've heard in

03:08:44.714 --> 03:08:47.383
multiple occasions different
supervisors and different folks

03:08:48.251 --> 03:08:50.386
say like, we're happy to provide
advice, we're happy to provide

03:08:51.222 --> 03:08:53.356
other sources of funding to
support this because transit is

03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:56.893
essential. And folks, I think
there's alignment on that, that

03:08:57.528 --> 03:09:00.429
piece of it at least. So
wondering if there's, you know,

03:09:00.497 --> 03:09:02.497
if that's an avenue we've

03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:04.700
explored or if we've had some

03:09:04.735 --> 03:09:06.636
success there. I mean, are you
asking a question about what

03:09:06.803 --> 03:09:09.407
should happen at the state level
or is it more at the local

03:09:09.407 --> 03:09:11.407
level? Well, if the state

03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:14.100
doesn't meet us, where we need

03:09:14.111 --> 03:09:16.111
to be to do that, what's the

03:09:16.714 --> 03:09:18.714
plan b? Is it local then at. And

03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:22.118
so that I would kind of defer,
if I can on just fare

03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:25.200
integration and our overall fare

03:09:25.890 --> 03:09:27.858
policy conversations that we
have. I mean at the state level,

03:09:27.959 --> 03:09:29.959
san francisco is really looked

03:09:30.695 --> 03:09:32.695
to as a model for the free and

03:09:33.197 --> 03:09:36.166
transit programs that we offer.
I mean, one of the probably

03:09:36.701 --> 03:09:38.701
among the most robust in the

03:09:40.204 --> 03:09:42.204
state. But I think that if we

03:09:42.807 --> 03:09:44.807
keep hammering on the same

03:09:45.310 --> 03:09:47.478
approach, which is just put more
money into free programs versus

03:09:48.346 --> 03:09:51.150
the approaches that that
director tumlin just outlined

03:09:52.217 --> 03:09:54.418
that are more comprehensive,
like the cal itp, which ties you

03:09:55.687 --> 03:09:58.355
to a family of programs so that
you know, you can benefit not

03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:02.760
just from discounts on your on
your utility bill, but also

03:10:03.662 --> 03:10:05.662
qualify for free transit. I

03:10:06.198 --> 03:10:08.299
think those are going to have a
better chance at success in my

03:10:09.101 --> 03:10:12.690
mind, maybe not a great answer,
but that's kind of where I see

03:10:12.871 --> 03:10:14.972
the. Yeah, yeah. It's a great
perspective. Thank you for that.

03:10:17.208 --> 03:10:19.208
Yeah, thanks. Seeing any other

03:10:20.312 --> 03:10:22.312
questions from my colleagues? I

03:10:23.715 --> 03:10:25.883
just had maybe 1 or 2, but I
can't believe this is our last

03:10:25.918 --> 03:10:28.586
conversation. Like this with
you, kane. Maybe you'll have to

03:10:29.388 --> 03:10:31.388
come. Come crash the

03:10:34.159 --> 03:10:36.393
conversation next year. So it's
very broad and all encompassing

03:10:37.697 --> 03:10:39.697
in order by design to give you

03:10:39.765 --> 03:10:42.633
flexibility to be opportunistic.
And, you know, when everything's
a priority, nothing's a

03:10:44.103 --> 03:10:46.370
priority. So I just wondered if
you might kind of help us

03:10:47.373 --> 03:10:50.274
understand what are like the
true priorities your staff will

03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:53.310
be prioritizing in the next year
. Yeah. Is it I mean, can we

03:10:54.514 --> 03:10:56.582
interpret it's like the number
one on the list. Number one of

03:10:57.483 --> 03:10:59.483
the categories is funding. Yeah

03:10:59.485 --> 03:11:01.686
I mean, I think what we try to
do because you were very clear

03:11:02.688 --> 03:11:05.123
in like in the 32nd elevator
speech, what's our top 3 or 4,

03:11:05.925 --> 03:11:07.992
right? And so at least if we're
talking about sacramento, we

03:11:08.961 --> 03:11:10.961
have those things listed here,

03:11:11.131 --> 03:11:13.131
which are, again, transportation

03:11:13.667 --> 03:11:15.467
funding. Right? I think we're
going to be spending you know,

03:11:17.270 --> 03:11:19.270
if it's a pie, a lot of that pie

03:11:19.372 --> 03:11:22.400
is going to be in that space
because of the conversation

03:11:22.740 --> 03:11:23.742
around the potential for a
regional measure, because of the

03:11:25.244 --> 03:11:28.460
whether there's going to be
legislation that would help or

03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:33.190
need to bridge some road to a
future regional measure. There's

03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:35.588
conversations around that that
were teed up by senator wiener

03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:38.924
in the context of bridge toll
bills. There is a lot going on

03:11:39.959 --> 03:11:42.862
around that. And a lot of
parties involved in that

03:11:45.631 --> 03:11:48.234
conversation from advocates in
the region, including spur bay

03:11:49.803 --> 03:11:52.238
area council transform a lot of
the social justice advocacy

03:11:53.730 --> 03:11:55.730
groups are also at that table

03:11:55.742 --> 03:11:57.742
along with transit agencies.

03:11:59.913 --> 03:12:02.381
Cmas and mtc. So we have to be
in that conversation. Director

03:12:04.180 --> 03:12:06.886
tumlin is fully part of those in
the leadership context, and then
we're supporting that at the

03:12:07.754 --> 03:12:10.190
staff level. I just think
realistically that's going to

03:12:10.958 --> 03:12:13.660
take that's going to be a lot of
work. Vision zero. I mean, the

03:12:13.794 --> 03:12:16.729
four things that are listed
here, right? Transportation
funding, vision zero, parking

03:12:17.965 --> 03:12:19.732
payment flexibility, autonomous
vehicles, those are four things

03:12:20.634 --> 03:12:22.634
that I think are going to rise

03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:25.380
to the top. And that's just some
offense, some defense. I think

03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:27.540
there's a lot of things that

03:12:28.109 --> 03:12:30.678
happen in in the work that we do
that are defense in nature, that

03:12:30.678 --> 03:12:33.646
we don't we're preventing harms
that we don't see, but we're

03:12:35.549 --> 03:12:37.617
ensuring that we kind of keep
keep some of those bad policies

03:12:38.953 --> 03:12:40.953
away from us as much as

03:12:40.955 --> 03:12:43.857
possible. And so I do feel like
those from the on the offense

03:12:45.126 --> 03:12:47.961
side, although avs could be both
offense and defense, I think

03:12:48.162 --> 03:12:50.765
those are the four priorities
that at least at the at the

03:12:50.765 --> 03:12:53.633
state level, let me be clear. I
don't want to give short shrift

03:12:54.368 --> 03:12:56.368
to the day to day dynamics of

03:12:57.172 --> 03:12:59.974
what happens with the board of
supervisors that joel and jeff

03:13:00.275 --> 03:13:02.275
and julie and others are

03:13:02.310 --> 03:13:04.578
managing constantly. Yeah. Okay.
And then just maybe my last

03:13:04.813 --> 03:13:07.581
question is just on vision zero.
Given like you talked about,

03:13:07.782 --> 03:13:09.782
like the two big priorities got

03:13:10.510 --> 03:13:12.510
done thanks to your leadership.

03:13:12.654 --> 03:13:14.654
We also know that those two were

03:13:15.324 --> 03:13:18.192
compromises and they were sort
of minimized for maybe our ideal

03:13:18.794 --> 03:13:21.462
version of both of those bills
in order to get across the

03:13:22.397 --> 03:13:24.565
finish line. So I just wonder
how you think about those things

03:13:26.601 --> 03:13:28.569
given vision zero is still a
priority going forward for the

03:13:29.571 --> 03:13:32.440
state and the years and years it
took to get these things done.

03:13:33.108 --> 03:13:35.108
Is this something that you think

03:13:36.111 --> 03:13:38.947
about as like the next 2.0 of
these things or like studying

03:13:39.648 --> 03:13:41.682
and learning? Of course, we
haven't implemented the speed

03:13:42.551 --> 03:13:44.752
safety cameras, but we know 33
is not nearly enough to cover

03:13:45.887 --> 03:13:47.755
the city. I guess if you can
help us how you're thinking

03:13:48.458 --> 03:13:50.793
about that. Yeah, I mean, I
think our large city dot

03:13:50.793 --> 03:13:53.695
coalition, which jeff is the
chair of, really keeps vision

03:13:54.396 --> 03:13:56.396
zero at the front of our kind of

03:13:56.665 --> 03:13:58.665
mutual interest in california.

03:13:58.968 --> 03:14:01.836
Right. And so if you were to say
four years ago, vision zero
people were like, what

03:14:03.405 --> 03:14:06.240
skepticism are we really? Do we
really have a speed problem?

03:14:06.810 --> 03:14:08.877
we're in the present moment. I
think we've brought people along

03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:10.812
on that journey. I think we've
had incredible support, frankly,

03:14:13.916 --> 03:14:15.916
from the federal administration

03:14:15.918 --> 03:14:17.918
who has embraced safe streets

03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:21.880
for all and all of those sort of

03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:23.190
agendas that we need to support

03:14:23.426 --> 03:14:26.228
policy work. In addition, the
ntsb, which supported us on

03:14:26.363 --> 03:14:28.664
speed safety cameras, has
brought its voice to new

03:14:29.232 --> 03:14:31.232
technology known as speed

03:14:32.669 --> 03:14:35.304
governors. And we have interest
amongst some of the folks that

03:14:36.973 --> 03:14:39.410
we're talking to as a tool, a
technology tool that could be

03:14:40.343 --> 03:14:42.778
explored. It's something that
new york is looking at, and it's

03:14:44.281 --> 03:14:46.281
the kind of technology that

03:14:46.750 --> 03:14:48.917
could be used in different ways,
whether it's on municipal

03:14:49.919 --> 03:14:51.919
fleets. As a pilot or exploring

03:14:52.222 --> 03:14:54.222
opportunities that might have

03:14:54.391 --> 03:14:56.391
benefits for insurance. As you

03:14:57.294 --> 03:14:59.362
know, the insurance you pay if
you're a driver and you

03:14:59.563 --> 03:15:01.563
volunteer to put a speed

03:15:01.899 --> 03:15:03.933
governor. So those are some of
the tactical or specific

03:15:05.169 --> 03:15:07.303
proposals that are out there in
the vision zero space. I don't

03:15:07.404 --> 03:15:09.404
think we're ever going to end

03:15:10.107 --> 03:15:12.875
that work, right. I mean, we
know it's aspirational, but

03:15:13.844 --> 03:15:16.478
there are specific things that
fall under that umbrella that I

03:15:16.547 --> 03:15:19.315
think we're going to be
advocating for. This year. Thank

03:15:21.285 --> 03:15:23.486
you. Yeah, no further questions.
I'll go to public comment on the

03:15:23.655 --> 03:15:25.655
legislative program for this

03:15:27.557 --> 03:15:30.159
year from anyone in the room
seeing none, please open a

03:15:30.461 --> 03:15:32.461
remote at this time. We'll move

03:15:33.898 --> 03:15:36.867
to remote public comment not to
exceed a total time of ten
minutes. Members of the public

03:15:37.335 --> 03:15:39.504
wishing to comment should dial
star three to enter the queue.

03:15:39.504 --> 03:15:41.504
each speaker will have two

03:15:43.593 --> 03:15:45.593
minutes. Moderate later for

03:15:49.113 --> 03:15:51.915
speaker. Hi this is barry
toronto. I don't know how I'm

03:15:52.817 --> 03:15:54.817
doing it, but I seem to be the

03:15:55.453 --> 03:15:58.121
first speaker on the list, so
appreciate it. A couple of

03:15:59.156 --> 03:16:01.156
things I noticed in your report.

03:16:01.326 --> 03:16:03.326
The report that there's a

03:16:03.528 --> 03:16:05.528
possibility ben-dahan reform

03:16:06.264 --> 03:16:08.264
next next year, or a proposal

03:16:08.333 --> 03:16:10.333
from kate turin and their staff.

03:16:10.535 --> 03:16:13.404
It would be great if it would
make sure that it was vetted

03:16:13.772 --> 03:16:16.707
first properly with the industry
and that any objections or any

03:16:17.642 --> 03:16:20.577
feedback from the industry be
shared with you in advance of

03:16:21.579 --> 03:16:23.579
any proposal that would go

03:16:23.615 --> 03:16:25.615
before you so it would be

03:16:25.851 --> 03:16:28.190
appreciative that that you made
sure the industry was completely

03:16:29.421 --> 03:16:31.421
involved and not just given

03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:36.920
perfunctory presentation. The

03:16:36.128 --> 03:16:38.128
next thing is, I urge you to ask

03:16:40.765 --> 03:16:42.765
your state legislators. To

03:16:44.436 --> 03:16:46.436
actually what do you call

03:16:47.373 --> 03:16:49.373
provide more regulation on on

03:16:50.175 --> 03:16:52.175
the tnc. As you can see, the

03:16:52.444 --> 03:16:54.444
state puc failed to understand

03:16:54.613 --> 03:16:56.613
the impact of autonomous

03:16:57.216 --> 03:16:59.719
vehicles on the on the san
francisco society as a whole.

03:17:00.854 --> 03:17:03.321
And look, the dmv ended up
suspending the license of crews

03:17:06.158 --> 03:17:08.794
and so the state puc is not to
be trusted concerning our

03:17:09.528 --> 03:17:11.528
electricity bills are going to

03:17:12.264 --> 03:17:14.999
go up many fold in in the next
year. So it would be

03:17:15.668 --> 03:17:18.503
appreciative that you include
that in your priorities is to

03:17:19.472 --> 03:17:22.374
get some legislative relief by
allowing cities and

03:17:23.776 --> 03:17:25.776
municipalities and counties to

03:17:26.780 --> 03:17:28.780
have some regular authority over

03:17:30.116 --> 03:17:32.116
tnc and also define last but not

03:17:32.351 --> 03:17:34.653
least, to find some money, some
debt relief for the purchase

03:17:35.722 --> 03:17:38.691
medallion holders who actually
have hired us divided as the

03:17:39.593 --> 03:17:42.528
taxi community between those who
get to work the airport and

03:17:42.729 --> 03:17:44.729
those who don't get to work the

03:17:44.965 --> 03:17:46.899
airport and the price and the
huge price break between the

03:17:48.635 --> 03:17:51.503
cavs that can operate only in
the city and those that can also

03:17:52.572 --> 03:17:55.241
operate at the airport. So it'd
be great if you include that in

03:17:55.609 --> 03:17:57.609
your legislative agenda. Thank

03:17:57.844 --> 03:17:59.979
you very much for your time.
Thank you. No additional

03:18:01.281 --> 03:18:03.281
speakers. Okay. We'll close

03:18:03.583 --> 03:18:05.751
public comment. Is there a
motion to approve the

03:18:08.655 --> 03:18:10.655
legislative program? So moved

03:18:11.425 --> 03:18:14.161
second. Second, let's call the
roll on the motion to approve

03:18:14.161 --> 03:18:17.630
director heminger heminger.
Director henderson henderson.

03:18:19.333 --> 03:18:21.333
Director hinsey. Hi, director.

03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:24.200
So I. So I. Director kahina. Hi

03:18:24.370 --> 03:18:26.839
kahina. I chair ekin. Hi. You
can I thank you. That item is

03:18:26.907 --> 03:18:29.676
approved. Thank you. Thank you.
Please call the next item places

03:18:29.744 --> 03:18:31.745
you on item number 12
presentation and discussion

03:18:33.381 --> 03:18:35.381
regarding a muni ford program

03:18:52.333 --> 03:18:54.333
update.

03:18:59.407 --> 03:19:01.407
Yeah okay. Well good afternoon,

03:19:01.709 --> 03:19:03.709
directors. Almost good evening.

03:19:04.879 --> 03:19:07.800
So sean kennedy, I'm the senior
senior manager for the transit

03:19:08.350 --> 03:19:10.350
planning group here at the mta.

03:19:10.652 --> 03:19:12.586
Last month I talked through a
service update and including

03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:16.323
some great news that we had seen
the highest ridership we had

03:19:17.958 --> 03:19:20.427
seen in the system in four
years. So I still want to want

03:19:21.363 --> 03:19:23.665
to want to give those kudos, but
this time I'm going to focus on

03:19:23.665 --> 03:19:25.665
some capital projects

03:19:26.100 --> 03:19:28.100
specifically our muni ford

03:19:28.103 --> 03:19:30.571
program. Also have some great
news to share and instead of

03:19:31.606 --> 03:19:34.174
burying the lead, I'll tell you
right now on the on the opening

03:19:35.310 --> 03:19:37.411
slide, that muni ford program is
turning ten years old in a

03:19:39.481 --> 03:19:41.481
couple months. Amazing that we

03:19:41.784 --> 03:19:44.180
are ten years old, which means
I'm ten years older and I

03:19:44.920 --> 03:19:46.988
definitely show my age. But
super excited about that. And

03:19:47.155 --> 03:19:49.155
even more importantly than that,

03:19:50.259 --> 03:19:53.160
this body has now approved over
100 miles of transit priority

03:19:54.196 --> 03:19:56.865
improvement projects in those
ten years. So, you know, ten

03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:00.702
miles a year on average, that is
phenomenal and has actually made

03:20:02.604 --> 03:20:04.805
sfmta really one of the
preeminent transit priority

03:20:05.808 --> 03:20:07.842
programs in the country. So
really, really exciting news.

03:20:10.612 --> 03:20:12.612
But before I get too far down

03:20:13.216 --> 03:20:15.717
that path, I want to take a step
back and just review how we got

03:20:17.487 --> 03:20:20.188
here. So as you guys know, you
know, san francisco has a number

03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:24.260
of unique challenges, especially
from a transit perspective. And

03:20:24.260 --> 03:20:26.728
san francisco is the second
densest city in the united

03:20:29.331 --> 03:20:32.234
states. Second only to new york,
unfortunately. And unlike new

03:20:32.702 --> 03:20:34.737
york, our previous transit
planners did not have the

03:20:37.140 --> 03:20:39.708
foresight to endow upon us a
really robust underground

03:20:41.878 --> 03:20:44.813
transit network and consequently
about 80 to 85% of our daily

03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:48.480
transit riders are doing so on

03:20:48.952 --> 03:20:51.854
the surface roads. And so you
know, there's a lot of competing

03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:54.550
needs in this. This picture was

03:20:54.924 --> 03:20:57.793
picked specifically to show just
about all those competing needs.
I think in one picture, it's

03:20:58.261 --> 03:21:00.930
pretty amazing, but there's a
lot of competing needs for that

03:21:00.930 --> 03:21:02.930
space. And consequently,

03:21:04.667 --> 03:21:06.802
congestion plays a highly
significant role in in how the

03:21:07.804 --> 03:21:09.804
system rolls out and how it's it

03:21:10.307 --> 03:21:12.307
operates. S and, you know, we

03:21:12.642 --> 03:21:14.642
can talk about and we have we do

03:21:15.145 --> 03:21:17.146
talk a lot about what that means
from an individual person's

03:21:17.414 --> 03:21:19.414
perspective, live on the system.

03:21:19.649 --> 03:21:21.650
You know, delay a long time to
get from a to b, very unreliable

03:21:23.587 --> 03:21:26.423
service. But I do want to take
two seconds to just point out

03:21:26.857 --> 03:21:29.760
the larger systemic impact that
has on the system. This is a

03:21:30.361 --> 03:21:33.290
pretty a pretty quick
illustration, but basically

03:21:34.498 --> 03:21:36.498
we're trying to point out here

03:21:36.566 --> 03:21:38.566
with this graph is that if you

03:21:38.602 --> 03:21:41.237
just had a 30 minute round trip
line, meaning you know, took you

03:21:43.107 --> 03:21:45.675
30 minutes to go from a to b and
then back to a so total round

03:21:45.676 --> 03:21:48.511
trip time. And you wanted to run
a ten minute headway that would

03:21:49.347 --> 03:21:51.514
take three busses. So the
average person on the street is

03:21:52.216 --> 03:21:54.951
standing there and they see a
bus coming by every ten minutes

03:21:55.653 --> 03:21:58.210
and it's costing us three busses
to run that service through

03:21:58.390 --> 03:22:01.910
congestion or other other
friction points in the system.

03:22:02.126 --> 03:22:04.126
If that trip time increases and

03:22:04.195 --> 03:22:07.970
in this case, say up to 45
minutes instead of half an hour,

03:22:08.466 --> 03:22:10.934
we're now having to put a bus
and a half, which obviously

03:22:12.236 --> 03:22:14.471
would really be two busses on
the system and that's going to

03:22:14.605 --> 03:22:16.974
cost us about 50% more in
operating costs. And just

03:22:18.910 --> 03:22:21.579
pointing out that this increase
in operating costs means nothing

03:22:22.347 --> 03:22:24.982
to the passenger. The person
standing on the street, they're

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:27.618
still seeing the bus just come
every ten minutes so they don't

03:22:28.386 --> 03:22:31.355
see an increase in service. They
think it's the same, but it's

03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:35.793
costing us 50% more to deliver
that service. And of course, the

03:22:37.297 --> 03:22:39.297
converse is true as well. If we

03:22:39.430 --> 03:22:41.430
can get that trip time down to

03:22:42.132 --> 03:22:44.200
20 minutes, you know, we can we
can save a whole bus. And what

03:22:45.903 --> 03:22:47.903
we do with that bus could be to

03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:51.975
make it come more frequently. So
now you get 7.5 minute service
or we can save that money and

03:22:52.443 --> 03:22:54.443
either bank it or use it on

03:22:55.113 --> 03:22:57.113
another line in the system. So

03:22:57.515 --> 03:22:59.515
taking that understanding, we

03:22:59.617 --> 03:23:01.617
developed the muni forward

03:23:02.486 --> 03:23:04.486
program ten years ago. It is a

03:23:04.521 --> 03:23:06.521
program that's near and dear to

03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:08.590
my heart. I came to the mta just

03:23:09.261 --> 03:23:11.261
to implement this program at the

03:23:11.330 --> 03:23:14.640
beginning it was me and a half
an fte and we've since been able

03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:17.900
to grow, grow that, grow that

03:23:17.902 --> 03:23:20.137
number quite, quite largely. But
you know have some amazing staff

03:23:20.705 --> 03:23:22.906
and some of them will be talking
here today. But you know,

03:23:23.975 --> 03:23:26.711
through partnership ups and
through working with the rest of

03:23:27.846 --> 03:23:29.846
transit operations, we've been

03:23:30.182 --> 03:23:32.650
able to deliver a lot of these
pretty amazing little tidbits

03:23:33.518 --> 03:23:35.518
and bullets to the overall

03:23:37.220 --> 03:23:39.923
program, including and not
limited to about 75 miles now of

03:23:40.692 --> 03:23:43.594
transit, only lanes in the city
in large part due to our close

03:23:43.929 --> 03:23:45.929
association with the transit

03:23:47.833 --> 03:23:49.833
engineering group at and the

03:23:51.937 --> 03:23:53.938
department of public works. So
we're pretty successful and

03:23:54.573 --> 03:23:56.573
we're so successful that four

03:23:56.875 --> 03:23:59.243
out of ten people in the last
budget budget's budget cycle

03:23:59.711 --> 03:24:01.711
said that hey, they really want

03:24:02.348 --> 03:24:04.517
the agency to spend more time
and more money and more

03:24:04.517 --> 03:24:06.517
resources continuing to advance

03:24:07.653 --> 03:24:09.653
these goals. And so here's the

03:24:10.356 --> 03:24:12.356
map of looking forward and back

03:24:13.250 --> 03:24:15.660
the blue lines is 100 miles that
we've already implemented. The

03:24:16.495 --> 03:24:18.897
gray lines is where we hope to
go. So over the next the next

03:24:20.566 --> 03:24:23.535
several years. And you know,
really shows a concentration in

03:24:25.304 --> 03:24:27.304
the near term on on our our on

03:24:28.307 --> 03:24:30.307
our lrv fleet or our our our

03:24:31.770 --> 03:24:33.812
train service. And but in
general, really connecting cross

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:38.350
town trips throughout the city
is where we'll be focusing this

03:24:41.487 --> 03:24:43.689
next round of improvements on in
addition to kind of these large

03:24:43.689 --> 03:24:46.491
corridor projects. We've you
know we've gotten very good at

03:24:46.492 --> 03:24:48.492
delivering project cradle to

03:24:48.795 --> 03:24:51.663
grave, you know, all the steps
and pitfalls along the way, be

03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:55.400
it technical, political, all

03:24:56.470 --> 03:24:58.570
monetary. You know, we've kind
of delivered and figured out

03:24:59.306 --> 03:25:01.574
ways to get around those. But I
think one of our most impressive

03:25:02.108 --> 03:25:04.409
and really exciting things that
we've done has gotten really

03:25:05.211 --> 03:25:07.470
good at reducing that time to
benefit ratio and getting

03:25:09.820 --> 03:25:11.820
projects for the most part, 90%

03:25:11.284 --> 03:25:13.519
in the ground. As soon as as
soon as this board approves

03:25:14.355 --> 03:25:16.622
them. And getting those elements
out there, one specific one that

03:25:17.491 --> 03:25:19.892
I'm super proud of is the l
taraval. You know, that was a

03:25:20.827 --> 03:25:22.827
safety project with some side

03:25:23.296 --> 03:25:25.296
transit benefits that we had 25

03:25:25.665 --> 03:25:27.867
people hit getting off the train
on. And the five year period

03:25:28.337 --> 03:25:30.403
before that project, we
implemented this board, approved

03:25:31.338 --> 03:25:33.338
that project and we implemented

03:25:33.707 --> 03:25:35.707
the quick build portion of that

03:25:36.760 --> 03:25:38.311
work as soon as we could. And
since then we haven't had any,

03:25:38.512 --> 03:25:40.512
any crashes on that corridor. So

03:25:41.810 --> 03:25:43.810
super exciting and really proud

03:25:44.818 --> 03:25:46.818
of that work. And you know, not

03:25:47.722 --> 03:25:49.889
only have we kind of figured out
how to how to improve safety,

03:25:51.192 --> 03:25:53.627
but people vote with their feet
and people are coming to muni

03:25:54.728 --> 03:25:56.728
forward corridors because we've

03:25:56.730 --> 03:25:58.264
been able to integrate service
improvements with capital

03:26:00.134 --> 03:26:02.502
improvement points as well as,
you know, operating management

03:26:03.405 --> 03:26:05.506
improvements like headway
management, all on these very

03:26:05.774 --> 03:26:07.774
important corridors, pre covid,

03:26:08.900 --> 03:26:10.900
we were seeing 15 to 20%

03:26:10.411 --> 03:26:12.411
ridership gains on on muni

03:26:13.140 --> 03:26:15.810
forward corridors and just as a
reminder, that was under the

03:26:16.184 --> 03:26:18.184
backdrop of the system in

03:26:18.419 --> 03:26:21.870
general was seen about a 3 to 4%
reduction in in transit

03:26:21.156 --> 03:26:23.156
ridership. And that carried

03:26:23.892 --> 03:26:25.892
through through covid, you know,

03:26:25.927 --> 03:26:28.280
through the lane program or the
temporary emergency transit

03:26:28.563 --> 03:26:30.563
lanes that we did during covid.

03:26:31.900 --> 03:26:33.900
You can see on here that, you

03:26:34.502 --> 03:26:36.904
know, the corridors where we did
muni forward and total work,

03:26:36.938 --> 03:26:39.140
we're seeing much higher
ridership gains than we are for

03:26:40.943 --> 03:26:42.943
system for system as a whole. So

03:26:43.245 --> 03:26:45.245
that's just some quick overview,

03:26:46.810 --> 03:26:48.810
overview numbers. But I'm going

03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:50.750
to bring up michael rhodes, who

03:26:50.852 --> 03:26:52.854
is our manager of transit
priority in general, and he's

03:26:52.854 --> 03:26:54.854
going to walk through some

03:26:55.230 --> 03:26:57.910
specific corridors and numbers
that we're seeing there. And

03:26:57.560 --> 03:26:59.727
then I'll come back and talk
about where we're going next. So

03:27:00.829 --> 03:27:03.531
with that, michael all right.
Thank you, sean, and good

03:27:06.435 --> 03:27:09.237
afternoon directors. Michael
rhodes, transit priority manager

03:27:09.371 --> 03:27:12.273
. I'm going to highlight some of
the programs accomplishments

03:27:13.109 --> 03:27:15.844
over the past decade at the
corridor level. So starting with

03:27:17.780 --> 03:27:19.780
the 14 mission corridor, since

03:27:19.915 --> 03:27:22.450
2016, we've made a series of
improvements across the entire

03:27:23.786 --> 03:27:26.587
14 mission route. We've added
transit lanes, bus bulbs, signal

03:27:27.823 --> 03:27:29.823
priority, bus stop spacing

03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:32.590
changes. We've increased rapid

03:27:32.195 --> 03:27:34.763
and local frequency on the
corridor and we've made

03:27:36.990 --> 03:27:38.990
pedestrian safety upgrades as

03:27:38.468 --> 03:27:40.902
well. So as for results, we've
seen, we saw a 99% ridership

03:27:41.737 --> 03:27:44.639
increase in the years before the
pandemic, sort of as an initial

03:27:46.608 --> 03:27:48.376
kind of result of that. And
since the pandemic started,

03:27:50.447 --> 03:27:53.215
we've seen a 92% recovery. We in
terms of ridership compared to

03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:56.151
pre-pandemic levels, which is
one of the strongest ridership

03:27:56.452 --> 03:27:58.654
recovery levels in our system,
and really especially impressive

03:27:58.688 --> 03:28:00.688
because the 14 does serve

03:28:00.757 --> 03:28:02.824
downtown in usually that sort of
an indicator of lower ridership

03:28:05.328 --> 03:28:07.328
recovery. But despite that, it's

03:28:07.330 --> 03:28:09.330
really doing great overall

03:28:09.399 --> 03:28:12.335
travel time on the 14 local end
end has been reduced by 9% since

03:28:14.104 --> 03:28:16.839
2015. Not just in the project
areas, but as a whole and travel

03:28:17.641 --> 03:28:19.641
time in the soma section of the

03:28:20.276 --> 03:28:22.276
line has been reduced by up to

03:28:22.345 --> 03:28:24.948
31% since bus lanes were added
as part of the title program in

03:28:25.716 --> 03:28:27.716
2021. We've also seen safety

03:28:27.818 --> 03:28:29.818
benefits for people walking.

03:28:30.387 --> 03:28:32.387
There's been a 33% reduction in

03:28:32.489 --> 03:28:34.590
pedestrian injury collisions on
mission street in the inner

03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:38.590
mission since that project was

03:28:39.663 --> 03:28:41.663
first implemented in 2016. Next,

03:28:41.666 --> 03:28:43.666
looking at the 22 fillmore

03:28:44.502 --> 03:28:46.736
corridor, we've also made a
series of improvements since

03:28:48.105 --> 03:28:50.807
2017, most dramatically, we
extended the 22 fillmore to

03:28:51.608 --> 03:28:53.608
mission bay and created the new

03:28:53.744 --> 03:28:55.744
55 dogpatch route. We've added

03:28:56.460 --> 03:28:58.916
bus lanes, bulbs, islands,
signal priority bus stop spacing

03:29:00.685 --> 03:29:02.685
changes, especially along 16th

03:29:02.820 --> 03:29:04.854
street and on church street. And
we've made pedestrian safety

03:29:05.423 --> 03:29:07.591
upgrades on this corridor as
well as we almost always do as

03:29:08.526 --> 03:29:11.261
part of muni forward projects.
So some of the results so far

03:29:11.863 --> 03:29:14.531
include a 102% ridership
recovered on the 22 and 55

03:29:14.531 --> 03:29:17.234
combined compared to
pre-pandemic and travel time

03:29:20.338 --> 03:29:22.572
savings of 1 to 2 minutes just
during the quick build phase of

03:29:23.700 --> 03:29:25.509
improvements on 16th street with
we expect a lot more than that

03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:27.910
as the full project comes to

03:29:29.981 --> 03:29:31.981
completion in the coming months.

03:29:32.249 --> 03:29:34.249
Of course, on geary, we've also

03:29:34.586 --> 03:29:36.653
focused some of our most
intensive and comprehensive

03:29:37.789 --> 03:29:40.240
improvements throughout the
entire route. So since 2018,

03:29:40.725 --> 03:29:42.725
we've implemented transit lanes,

03:29:42.827 --> 03:29:45.796
bulbs, signal priority, stop
spacing changes, many other

03:29:45.864 --> 03:29:47.864
reliability upgrades similar to

03:29:48.700 --> 03:29:50.868
the last two corridors, not to
mention some older transit lanes

03:29:51.837 --> 03:29:54.720
that we did as part of the
original transit first policy in

03:29:54.406 --> 03:29:57.108
1970s and upgrading with red
colorization in about ten years

03:29:58.343 --> 03:30:00.311
ago. So we've also, of course,
made pedestrian safety

03:30:00.445 --> 03:30:02.445
improvements, but also urban

03:30:03.381 --> 03:30:05.549
design upgrades on geary as part
of the projects we've done. And

03:30:07.152 --> 03:30:09.321
so some of the results for geary
looking at, you know, looking

03:30:09.655 --> 03:30:12.290
specifically at the geary rapid
project, which is in the sort of

03:30:12.558 --> 03:30:14.726
middle section of the line
through the western addition

03:30:15.961 --> 03:30:17.961
japantown, we saw up to an 18%

03:30:18.197 --> 03:30:21.990
decrease in 38 hour travel time,
up to a 37% improvement in

03:30:22.134 --> 03:30:24.134
reliability or reduction in the

03:30:24.636 --> 03:30:26.636
variability of travel time and

03:30:26.739 --> 03:30:29.708
70 to 80% reduction in vehicles
going over 40mph. So on the

03:30:30.243 --> 03:30:32.243
safety side, we really saw the

03:30:32.712 --> 03:30:34.712
safety benefits of reducing the

03:30:35.181 --> 03:30:37.415
roadway for general vehicles in
terms of equity by calling the

03:30:37.883 --> 03:30:40.151
geary expressway and japantown
in western addition

03:30:41.353 --> 03:30:43.489
neighborhoods. The project has
helped to reconnect communities

03:30:44.858 --> 03:30:46.858
that were harmed by 1960s urban

03:30:50.697 --> 03:30:53.650
renewal policies. To get a sense
of the scale of transit lane

03:30:54.434 --> 03:30:56.568
expansion, in particular, that's
just one part of the toolkit

03:30:57.870 --> 03:31:00.707
with muni forward, but it's one
of the most visible this series

03:31:00.707 --> 03:31:02.908
of slides shows the growth of
transit lanes in the city from

03:31:03.810 --> 03:31:05.810
2006 to today. So this is 2006,

03:31:05.846 --> 03:31:07.846
a much more limited transit lane

03:31:08.181 --> 03:31:10.181
network than we have out there

03:31:13.186 --> 03:31:15.186
right now. And this is 2013. So

03:31:15.922 --> 03:31:17.922
right before muni forward was

03:31:18.459 --> 03:31:21.227
fully launched, there are some
new additions compared to 2006,

03:31:21.628 --> 03:31:23.696
like adding the t-third transit
lanes along third street, but

03:31:24.765 --> 03:31:27.266
not a ton of change. You know,
we hadn't we hadn't yet really

03:31:28.100 --> 03:31:30.100
ramped up at that point. And

03:31:32.720 --> 03:31:34.206
here we are in 2023 today as you
can see, there's been a huge

03:31:34.741 --> 03:31:36.843
expansion of transit lanes over
the last decade under the muni

03:31:37.712 --> 03:31:40.580
forward program. In fact, just
since 2020. So just the last 3

03:31:41.582 --> 03:31:43.716
or 4 years, there's been a 33%
increase in the transit lane

03:31:43.984 --> 03:31:46.753
network. We've also begun
colorizing many transit lanes

03:31:47.488 --> 03:31:49.488
red as you can see here, which

03:31:52.392 --> 03:31:55.195
increases compliance by over 50%
and this slide shows transit

03:31:55.363 --> 03:31:57.363
lanes that are already approved

03:31:58.650 --> 03:32:00.967
as well as some that will be. So
basically, this is everything
we've already got, plus what's

03:32:01.502 --> 03:32:04.471
coming soon, recently approved
projects. We're continuing, as

03:32:05.406 --> 03:32:07.406
you can see, to add many more

03:32:09.243 --> 03:32:12.145
transit lanes in the years ahead
. And here are some of the most

03:32:12.847 --> 03:32:15.749
recent muni forward projects
we've completed just in the last
few months. So that would

03:32:17.919 --> 03:32:19.586
include the quick build transit
lanes on hyde street that you

03:32:20.588 --> 03:32:23.890
just approved last month, the
geary boulevard. Quick build

03:32:23.224 --> 03:32:26.126
improvements which are nearly
complete now, the 28 19th avenue

03:32:27.194 --> 03:32:29.230
muni forward project, which
added transit bulbs and other

03:32:29.598 --> 03:32:32.132
upgrades on 19th avenue, is now
substantially complete at 27

03:32:32.968 --> 03:32:35.669
bryant muni forward project,
which also added a significant
number of bulbs and the

03:32:36.638 --> 03:32:39.473
tenderloin and nob hill
neighborhoods, russian hill, a

03:32:41.209 --> 03:32:43.810
queue jump bus lane for the 30
stockton on townsend street and

03:32:45.881 --> 03:32:47.949
red transit lane colorization on
mission street in soma. So

03:32:48.984 --> 03:32:50.618
that's just in the last few
months. Some of the projects

03:32:53.922 --> 03:32:56.891
we've completed. And you we also
have seven projects that are

03:32:56.958 --> 03:32:58.958
currently in the detailed design

03:32:58.960 --> 03:33:01.950
or construction phase. So these
are projects that are already

03:33:02.163 --> 03:33:04.298
approved but are kind of in the
detailed design or construction

03:33:05.340 --> 03:33:06.734
phase. You can see that we
expect construction to wrap up

03:33:07.536 --> 03:33:09.871
soon on the 22 fillmore on 16th
street. That's just about done.

03:33:10.539 --> 03:33:12.640
And we expect construction to be
completed next year on five

03:33:13.275 --> 03:33:15.275
fulton bulbs in the inner

03:33:15.544 --> 03:33:17.544
richmond and the taraval muni

03:33:17.546 --> 03:33:19.546
forward project and we expect

03:33:20.490 --> 03:33:22.651
construction to occur from about
2025 to 2027 and beyond. On the

03:33:22.718 --> 03:33:24.753
sort of permanent version of
some projects that already have

03:33:26.122 --> 03:33:28.590
had quick builds. So the church
muni forward 29 sunset phase one

03:33:29.391 --> 03:33:31.926
project and the geary boulevard
improvement project, permanent

03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:36.229
version. So I'll send it back to

03:33:37.266 --> 03:33:40.168
sean for the rest of it. Great.
Thank you, michael. So just what

03:33:41.971 --> 03:33:43.971
is coming up next in the near

03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:46.240
term? We are really focusing on

03:33:46.275 --> 03:33:48.143
the rail system in the near
term. Michael will be coming

03:33:48.878 --> 03:33:51.413
back up in a few minutes. We
have an info item on the m that

03:33:52.615 --> 03:33:55.483
will be in your next item. We're
also hoping to bring forward the

03:33:56.520 --> 03:33:58.854
k ingleside work that we've been
working closely with. Supervisor

03:34:00.230 --> 03:34:02.230
melgar's office on ocean. We're

03:34:02.192 --> 03:34:04.293
we're hoping in the JANUARY to
FEBRUARY time frame for that

03:34:05.328 --> 03:34:07.328
project that and then we'll be

03:34:07.330 --> 03:34:09.497
shifting staff resources to
those, those next five bullets

03:34:10.466 --> 03:34:12.466
you see there. Most notably the

03:34:13.336 --> 03:34:15.336
t third that as you know, does

03:34:15.772 --> 03:34:17.772
have a transit line. So a lot of

03:34:18.750 --> 03:34:20.976
a lot of dedicated right of way.
But, you know, it needs a lot of

03:34:21.278 --> 03:34:23.278
help still. So we'll be focusing

03:34:24.381 --> 03:34:27.215
on there. And we do also hope to
be leaning heavily on some of

03:34:28.217 --> 03:34:30.854
our international colleagues on
figuring out how some other

03:34:30.988 --> 03:34:33.657
cities around the world really
are dealing with the kind of

03:34:33.657 --> 03:34:35.657
things we're seeing on the on

03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:38.930
the t third line as we improve

03:34:38.228 --> 03:34:40.596
that corridor and then, of
course, the j church, the

03:34:41.531 --> 03:34:44.299
portion of noe valley is on
there and the n judah, why we're

03:34:45.202 --> 03:34:48.170
focusing so much on the rail in
the next year, year and a half

03:34:48.339 --> 03:34:50.774
is because we're also working
our long range arm of our group

03:34:51.609 --> 03:34:53.511
is working on a muni metro
modernization project that's

03:34:53.878 --> 03:34:55.878
really focusing on the subway

03:34:57.815 --> 03:35:00.150
and, you know, we you know, the
subway will only be as good as

03:35:01.151 --> 03:35:03.753
what's coming into it, right? So
you got to fix the subway, but

03:35:04.540 --> 03:35:06.590
you also got to got to address
bus problems and delays and

03:35:07.792 --> 03:35:09.792
issues on the surface as well.

03:35:10.561 --> 03:35:12.561
So it'll all work together as as

03:35:12.696 --> 03:35:15.432
one one system. So that leaves
us to it leads us rather to the

03:35:16.901 --> 03:35:18.901
what is the vision and the

03:35:19.770 --> 03:35:21.770
vision here as actually laid out

03:35:22.507 --> 03:35:24.675
in the connect work, we call
this the five minute network.

03:35:25.477 --> 03:35:27.711
It's really obviously a service
service vernacular, but this

03:35:30.648 --> 03:35:32.716
really is a capital map. We are
marrying, of course, as we've

03:35:33.284 --> 03:35:35.519
kind of been talking about the
service and the capital sides of

03:35:36.420 --> 03:35:39.322
the house. And so while we're
talking about five minute

03:35:39.490 --> 03:35:41.492
service on these red corridors,
that also means that the vision

03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:45.396
is that these these these busses
and trains are only stopping at

03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:47.830
transit stops. They're going to

03:35:48.133 --> 03:35:50.133
be hopefully a surface level

03:35:50.535 --> 03:35:53.370
subway is what what the vision
is. And you know, this is

03:35:54.105 --> 03:35:56.273
obviously going to take take a
while. So that's why we're not

03:35:57.800 --> 03:35:59.711
promising this in the next few
years. But we are going to be

03:36:01.480 --> 03:36:03.548
advancing toward this idea,
which means we're going to be

03:36:04.516 --> 03:36:06.517
going back to many of the
corridors that we've already

03:36:06.585 --> 03:36:09.219
done moving forward projects on
to get even hopefully more

03:36:09.321 --> 03:36:11.755
improvements on those corridors
and eventually reach toward this

03:36:12.824 --> 03:36:14.824
idea of just stopping at transit

03:36:15.428 --> 03:36:17.562
stops on these on these major
routes. So that's where we're

03:36:19.131 --> 03:36:21.366
at. And I'd love to take any
questions or comments. Thank you

03:36:22.414 --> 03:36:24.414
so much. Colleagues, are there

03:36:29.341 --> 03:36:31.341
questions for the presenters. So

03:36:33.646 --> 03:36:36.548
go ahead. See here. That's good.
This is a really great

03:36:37.516 --> 03:36:40.351
presentation. It sounds like
it's amazing. We did a lot of

03:36:41.987 --> 03:36:43.721
great thing and it's well
fitting, like happy

03:36:46.425 --> 03:36:48.593
thanksgiving, you know? And I am
looking at your pie chart on

03:36:49.862 --> 03:36:51.862
like the community priorities

03:36:52.732 --> 03:36:54.732
for sfmta for the next upcoming

03:36:55.835 --> 03:36:57.835
fiscal two years of 22 and

03:36:58.871 --> 03:37:00.939
2,614. Well are you going to go
back to the slide? Yeah okay.

03:37:02.141 --> 03:37:05.430
Let me pull it up. Yeah. So the
second highest priorities are,

03:37:05.911 --> 03:37:07.911
you know, 14% of them identify

03:37:09.549 --> 03:37:11.549
that personal safety for muni

03:37:12.185 --> 03:37:14.185
riders. I would love to hear

03:37:17.456 --> 03:37:19.456
what we have in your in your

03:37:20.260 --> 03:37:22.260
pipeline, how we can address the

03:37:22.428 --> 03:37:24.428
second priorities of from the

03:37:24.898 --> 03:37:26.898
communities. That's great. So

03:37:26.934 --> 03:37:28.934
the couple couple answers there

03:37:29.136 --> 03:37:32.400
one from from within my group
and within my cip program we've

03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:35.400
started a lighting program at

03:37:35.775 --> 03:37:37.775
stops. So, you know, one of the

03:37:38.211 --> 03:37:40.279
issues is that that people feel
when they're waiting at stops,

03:37:40.714 --> 03:37:42.714
when it's when it's darker out,

03:37:42.917 --> 03:37:45.518
very unsafe. It's just not a
great feeling to be in a dark,

03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:49.221
dark locale. So we have some
money set aside in our cip.

03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:52.910
We're doing a pilot program of
that on the line that that

03:37:53.193 --> 03:37:54.860
michael will talk about here in
a minute. Where we're we're

03:37:57.531 --> 03:37:59.798
practicing, we're there's not
lighting at a lot of these stops

03:38:01.335 --> 03:38:02.936
for a lot of a lot of really
legitimate reasons, you know

03:38:03.471 --> 03:38:05.471
dollar reasons, you know how

03:38:05.906 --> 03:38:07.974
much is it going to cost? Can we
look at other alternatives like

03:38:08.976 --> 03:38:11.444
like solar lighting? Can we can
we can we do things that don't

03:38:12.446 --> 03:38:14.747
necessarily mean running conduit
, you know, five, 600ft? That

03:38:15.649 --> 03:38:18.618
cost costs a lot of money. So we
are going to be doing this pilot

03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:21.420
on the m line to see if there's

03:38:21.956 --> 03:38:23.957
other ways that we can get some
lighting at stops. We also have

03:38:24.825 --> 03:38:27.527
a bus stop program that we're
kind of brushing off all of our

03:38:28.963 --> 03:38:31.865
bus stop signage throughout the
system. That includes a little

03:38:32.666 --> 03:38:34.666
what we call a birdhouse on the

03:38:34.936 --> 03:38:36.971
top of the signs that have some
ambient lighting. Not enough

03:38:37.380 --> 03:38:39.380
lighting that you can read a

03:38:39.740 --> 03:38:41.108
book by, but they are solar
powered and do hopefully give

03:38:42.430 --> 03:38:45.120
off a little bit of lighting to
at least let operators know that

03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:47.914
there's a there's a stop there
and then there's a whole nother

03:38:49.583 --> 03:38:52.254
program that kim burris and the
safety team is working on,

03:38:52.254 --> 03:38:54.254
trying to improve personal

03:38:55.323 --> 03:38:57.458
safety on on the bus itself. So
there's a couple of different

03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:00.760
levels we're working on on the

03:39:00.996 --> 03:39:03.197
street level as well as on the
on the bus side. Thank you for

03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:06.533
that. And yeah, I'd like to hear
a little bit more about what kim

03:39:07.268 --> 03:39:09.268
is also in charge of doing

03:39:10.139 --> 03:39:13.107
because it's really important
for every one of us to feel safe

03:39:15.310 --> 03:39:17.310
in the bus and getting off the

03:39:19.281 --> 03:39:21.749
bus. Yeah. Um, but I realized
that you and michael are more

03:39:22.784 --> 03:39:24.784
focused on the actual

03:39:24.953 --> 03:39:26.953
infrastructure aspect of the

03:39:28.324 --> 03:39:30.458
muni forward project. So let me
share with you some of the

03:39:34.262 --> 03:39:36.262
senior hours or seniors and also

03:39:36.932 --> 03:39:39.467
a little older adult riders that
they've been telling me that

03:39:40.869 --> 03:39:42.869
they wish that they can see the

03:39:42.971 --> 03:39:44.971
digital sign for upcoming busses

03:39:48.845 --> 03:39:50.979
because they are very reluctant
to take their phone out in

03:39:52.148 --> 03:39:54.148
public these days because of the

03:39:54.983 --> 03:39:56.983
worry of their personal safety.

03:39:57.953 --> 03:39:59.953
Waiting at a even a very well

03:40:02.258 --> 03:40:04.258
lit bus stop and do you have any

03:40:05.428 --> 03:40:07.428
updates on that progress? Yes.

03:40:09.650 --> 03:40:11.650
So I do not. Jeff, do you have

03:40:12.201 --> 03:40:14.403
any we would be delighted to
give you. We're probably past

03:40:15.771 --> 03:40:17.973
due for an update from our chief
of security, kimberly burris,

03:40:18.841 --> 03:40:20.841
talking about the gender safety

03:40:20.911 --> 03:40:23.579
equity initiative, as well as
what we're doing with

03:40:23.580 --> 03:40:25.580
technology, with our transit

03:40:25.749 --> 03:40:27.616
ambassadors and with our fare
inspectors. And we're probably

03:40:28.318 --> 03:40:31.153
also due for an update on
technology, including the

03:40:32.388 --> 03:40:34.388
replacement of all of our real

03:40:35.591 --> 03:40:38.460
time information panels as the
first phase of that work, as

03:40:39.696 --> 03:40:42.531
well as the next phases of that
work, which we are eager to

03:40:44.670 --> 03:40:46.670
fund. Because not only does that

03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:48.471
information help people who are
afraid of taking out their

03:40:49.473 --> 03:40:52.241
phone, just the mere presence of
that information actually helps

03:40:53.576 --> 03:40:55.576
to increase confidence for all

03:40:55.813 --> 03:40:57.813
riders just as improvements in

03:40:57.882 --> 03:41:00.350
speed and reliability. We hear
from our passengers a lot that

03:41:00.418 --> 03:41:02.418
the greatest concerns that they

03:41:02.719 --> 03:41:04.554
have have are on our lower
frequency and less reliable

03:41:05.355 --> 03:41:08.230
lines because you're standing
there and you don't know when

03:41:08.792 --> 03:41:11.427
the next bus is coming and
that's when our riders get very

03:41:12.730 --> 03:41:14.730
nervous. So when you can see the

03:41:14.899 --> 03:41:17.133
next bus coming, that provides a
great deal of reassurance for

03:41:18.869 --> 03:41:21.771
our passengers is great looking
forward to see those
presentations. Then thank you.

03:41:22.873 --> 03:41:24.873
Thank you. Director hensley,

03:41:27.744 --> 03:41:30.614
please add thank you again for
this presentation. Thank you

03:41:32.317 --> 03:41:34.317
again for the presentation.

03:41:35.620 --> 03:41:37.620
Every your team is doing great

03:41:38.356 --> 03:41:40.356
work. I just had a couple of

03:41:40.992 --> 03:41:42.992
questions. Um one is not really

03:41:43.594 --> 03:41:45.594
related to muni forward, but

03:41:45.796 --> 03:41:47.796
it's in your purview. I know.

03:41:47.899 --> 03:41:49.899
So, um, prior to the pandemic,

03:41:52.700 --> 03:41:54.700
you all had like a hotspot

03:41:56.374 --> 03:41:58.342
program for like, stop immediate
, quick build type improvements

03:42:00.211 --> 03:42:02.211
that were less slightly less

03:42:03.781 --> 03:42:06.751
intensive than, um, muni
forward. Um, I know your group

03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:10.200
is very busy, but is that still

03:42:12.858 --> 03:42:15.826
a thing? Um you did like the ten
hotspots or. Yeah I forget what

03:42:16.628 --> 03:42:18.628
it was, but yeah, that's, that's

03:42:20.310 --> 03:42:22.232
a great memory. Yes, we, we, we
did the ten hotspots. It was

03:42:24.690 --> 03:42:26.404
based on just overall delay. So
you know, the muni forward

03:42:26.472 --> 03:42:28.472
program is really focused on

03:42:29.740 --> 03:42:31.740
where the most passengers are

03:42:31.376 --> 03:42:33.544
and thus the most aggregate
delay. But we also wanted to

03:42:34.212 --> 03:42:36.212
look at where just busses in

03:42:36.281 --> 03:42:38.820
general or trains in general
were getting stuck regardless of

03:42:39.752 --> 03:42:42.654
ridership. And it was really our
way to address some of the some

03:42:42.688 --> 03:42:44.688
of the lower frequency, you

03:42:45.558 --> 03:42:47.558
know, lower ridership lines,

03:42:48.226 --> 03:42:50.226
like things like the 54, the 52,

03:42:50.729 --> 03:42:52.729
the 37. And so we did the

03:42:53.899 --> 03:42:55.866
initial top ten list. Those have
all been implemented. Those

03:42:56.803 --> 03:42:58.803
those improvements have been are

03:42:59.105 --> 03:43:01.940
on the ground now. And we are in
the process right now of

03:43:02.708 --> 03:43:04.708
developing a next or another top

03:43:05.311 --> 03:43:08.113
ten list that we will be taking
up in this in this fiscal year

03:43:08.747 --> 03:43:10.747
coming up. So that program is

03:43:12.784 --> 03:43:15.621
ongoing and then there'll
there'll be more on that'll be

03:43:16.556 --> 03:43:18.556
also more on the community lines

03:43:18.792 --> 03:43:20.792
. Yes, long lines. I'm assuming.

03:43:22.829 --> 03:43:24.829
Okay, great. And then michael's,

03:43:25.980 --> 03:43:27.980
um, sort of timeline slide

03:43:28.701 --> 03:43:30.701
inspired a question for me is

03:43:34.841 --> 03:43:36.841
these larger sort of capital

03:43:37.310 --> 03:43:39.310
projects that we're approving

03:43:39.479 --> 03:43:41.479
along with a quick build phase,

03:43:43.650 --> 03:43:45.650
are like are the capital

03:43:45.685 --> 03:43:47.685
portions of those projects, are

03:43:48.988 --> 03:43:50.957
they funded or or are you still
looking for funding for those

03:43:52.250 --> 03:43:54.927
all of those projects on that
slide are funded? Okay. We, you

03:43:55.829 --> 03:43:57.829
know, detailed design just takes

03:43:59.299 --> 03:44:02.201
takes a while. But yes, we have
all of the all of those are

03:44:03.103 --> 03:44:05.103
funded and are ready to go from

03:44:05.305 --> 03:44:07.305
a funding standpoint. Again, can

03:44:08.976 --> 03:44:11.678
can congratulations the nice
nice item for us to go into the

03:44:13.113 --> 03:44:15.214
holiday with thank you MADAM
Chair. Thank you vice chair

03:44:16.483 --> 03:44:18.483
kahina please. Um, first off,

03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:21.520
congratulations, owens, on your

03:44:22.823 --> 03:44:24.924
anniversary. Sean, I'm glad that
you've been with us for ten

03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:27.861
years, and thank you for all
your work in these past ten

03:44:31.799 --> 03:44:33.799
years. Um I. I loved seeing the

03:44:34.635 --> 03:44:36.635
14 numbers. I'm an avid 14 and

03:44:36.737 --> 03:44:38.737
14 are specific writer, so it

03:44:38.739 --> 03:44:41.674
was great to see all the numbers
there. Um, I did have a question

03:44:44.612 --> 03:44:46.612
on a lot of our red lines tend

03:44:46.714 --> 03:44:48.714
to be in on commercial corridors

03:44:48.949 --> 03:44:50.949
and so a lot of community

03:44:52.186 --> 03:44:54.821
members there often cite that
the red lanes are impacting

03:44:56.424 --> 03:44:58.892
business and they've seen a
decrease in business activity

03:45:01.290 --> 03:45:03.564
and a lot of, you know,
vacancies arising. And there's

03:45:04.132 --> 03:45:06.132
usually this like argument that

03:45:06.167 --> 03:45:08.167
there's a causality between in

03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:10.570
redlands and business. S so I

03:45:11.139 --> 03:45:13.373
just was wondering if you all
have done some analysis on that

03:45:15.610 --> 03:45:18.545
and if you do want to take some
time to share, if you have done

03:45:19.381 --> 03:45:21.682
some analysis on that, what that
has resulted in, we've done some

03:45:22.584 --> 03:45:24.584
analysis, you know, tax tax

03:45:24.653 --> 03:45:27.622
numbers are a little bit lagging
behind. You actual

03:45:28.423 --> 03:45:30.524
implementation and ridership
numbers and things like that.

03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:33.590
But we have looked, for example,

03:45:33.595 --> 03:45:35.563
on the l, we had a lot of
reports of people saying that

03:45:37.933 --> 03:45:40.340
their business was was lower. So
we looked at business close

03:45:41.300 --> 03:45:42.803
rates. We also looked at overall
tax revenue because it's been

03:45:43.639 --> 03:45:45.906
long enough now that we've that
we've got some numbers is

03:45:45.907 --> 03:45:48.375
actually the close rates on
taraval were less than the city

03:45:49.711 --> 03:45:51.711
as a whole you know even though

03:45:52.140 --> 03:45:53.748
of course to those individual
businesses that that was still

03:45:55.384 --> 03:45:58.253
impactful and tax rates were
about about what we were seeing

03:45:59.355 --> 03:46:01.756
on citywide. So you know, we
didn't see any any cause

03:46:03.358 --> 03:46:05.826
causation there. But know that's
just one corridor we got. We got

03:46:06.895 --> 03:46:09.960
to continue to look at that. And
that's one of the things, you

03:46:10.199 --> 03:46:11.900
know, I talked about in a couple
of months. It's technically

03:46:12.402 --> 03:46:14.402
march that muni returns ten. But

03:46:14.570 --> 03:46:16.570
sometime in this fiscal year,

03:46:16.939 --> 03:46:19.240
we're hoping to get before or
after project put together.

03:46:20.409 --> 03:46:22.710
Looking back at the last ten
years of muni forward, both from

03:46:22.812 --> 03:46:24.812
a benefit and also lessons

03:46:24.947 --> 03:46:26.947
learned and standpoint. And that

03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:30.586
will include a look at tax
numbers on on those major

03:46:31.521 --> 03:46:33.521
corridors. So we do we do hope

03:46:35.191 --> 03:46:37.359
within the next year to have
something out that that speaks
to that directly. I would

03:46:37.727 --> 03:46:39.894
definitely encourage that
analysis to occur in the mission

03:46:41.464 --> 03:46:44.332
district specifically because I
do think that a lot of the

03:46:45.268 --> 03:46:48.170
narrative out there that there
is this causality between

03:46:49.639 --> 03:46:51.840
redlands and business activity,
reduced business activity along

03:46:51.975 --> 03:46:54.778
commercial corridors, creates
this fear factor for a lot of

03:46:54.778 --> 03:46:57.679
folks. And implementing redlands
in their respect of

03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:01.480
neighborhoods. So I think it's a

03:47:02.186 --> 03:47:04.654
worthwhile effort to just, you
know, see if there's any truth

03:47:05.922 --> 03:47:07.922
to that. And what we can do to

03:47:08.191 --> 03:47:10.590
support business as if that is,
in fact an impact that we're

03:47:11.762 --> 03:47:13.762
having. Um the other piece I was

03:47:14.397 --> 03:47:16.397
going to touch on is as a avid

03:47:17.500 --> 03:47:20.336
14, our writer, um, there is a
lot of double parking in the

03:47:20.938 --> 03:47:22.772
mission district and so I do
wonder, you know, when we do

03:47:26.109 --> 03:47:28.544
have these dedicated lanes, um,
we don't oftentimes have

03:47:29.646 --> 03:47:31.646
capacity to, you know, have

03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:34.850
enforcement and ensure that
they're actually clear for, for

03:47:36.419 --> 03:47:38.622
our busses to pass through. And
so I just wanted to see like

03:47:40.124 --> 03:47:41.925
what work effort your team is
thinking about to, to you know,

03:47:43.393 --> 03:47:45.393
address that challenge. If

03:47:45.729 --> 03:47:48.970
you're seeing that as a as a
huge challenge or not. And yeah,

03:47:48.999 --> 03:47:50.999
just get your thoughts on that.

03:47:52.536 --> 03:47:54.403
We are and cathy one of my one
of my staff is here is put

03:47:56.400 --> 03:47:58.750
together a really great program
for that very for that very

03:47:59.877 --> 03:48:01.978
issue. We're looking at a couple
of different things, both

03:48:03.114 --> 03:48:05.114
education wise. So we've got

03:48:06.170 --> 03:48:08.170
some new stickers that are going

03:48:08.118 --> 03:48:09.819
on the backs of busses that say
cameron force that will be going

03:48:10.721 --> 03:48:12.721
up and down basically on every

03:48:12.991 --> 03:48:15.920
bus in our system. Of course,
only only actually is where

03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:17.460
there's transit lanes, but also

03:48:18.196 --> 03:48:20.196
cape brian's great work to get,

03:48:20.732 --> 03:48:22.799
you know, camera enforcement on
our transit lanes themselves. It

03:48:24.350 --> 03:48:26.103
used to be only double parking.
It's moving into, you know,

03:48:28.139 --> 03:48:30.139
actually vehicles blocking the

03:48:30.242 --> 03:48:33.177
transit lane and then we you
know, we are also working with

03:48:35.880 --> 03:48:38.115
the pco, sean mccormick and his
group to make that a little bit

03:48:39.317 --> 03:48:42.119
more of an upgrade. The
technology and make it a little

03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:44.520
bit more of a easier process.

03:48:44.923 --> 03:48:47.492
Right now we have two pco's that
sit in a small room and review

03:48:48.327 --> 03:48:50.495
tape all day long and where
we're seeing double parking not

03:48:51.296 --> 03:48:53.531
the not the most efficient way
to do things. So with the new

03:48:53.665 --> 03:48:55.665
cameras that we're getting,

03:48:56.680 --> 03:48:58.736
we're in the test period right
now on these new cameras and it

03:48:59.838 --> 03:49:02.173
takes pictures so the pco's can
go right to the spot where the

03:49:05.265 --> 03:49:07.245
camera thinks somebody was
violating the red lane. And then

03:49:07.413 --> 03:49:09.413
the pco pco's actually make the

03:49:11.576 --> 03:49:13.651
call. If it's if it if it did or
didn't, because the camera can
pick up some other stuff. But

03:49:14.352 --> 03:49:16.520
but that's going to greatly
reduce the amount of time and

03:49:17.422 --> 03:49:19.590
effort that it takes to give
out, give out those those

03:49:21.260 --> 03:49:23.795
tickets. Yeah I'm not
encouraging a lot of tickets out

03:49:24.300 --> 03:49:26.197
there, but I just want to make
sure that, you know, there

03:49:26.899 --> 03:49:29.201
functioning as as we're
designing and it is interesting

03:49:29.368 --> 03:49:31.636
that you know most of the
tickets that we give you know, I

03:49:32.605 --> 03:49:34.605
we have sean follow up with the

03:49:35.400 --> 03:49:37.308
exact number but a high
percentage of those numbers are

03:49:38.811 --> 03:49:41.313
are associated with repeat
offenders and it's groups or

03:49:42.849 --> 03:49:45.484
people that you know don't don't
seem to mind if they get a

03:49:47.153 --> 03:49:49.254
ticket or or whatnot. You know
delivery trucks you know fedex

03:49:50.256 --> 03:49:53.240
type things versus, you know,
the individuals usually with an

03:49:54.600 --> 03:49:56.761
individual, we ticket them once
and we don't see that much

03:49:57.964 --> 03:49:59.964
repeat issues there. So thank

03:50:00.667 --> 03:50:02.667
you for that. The other thing I

03:50:03.336 --> 03:50:05.204
would love to see in a future
for presentation is the operator

03:50:07.607 --> 03:50:09.607
perspective on how these

03:50:09.642 --> 03:50:12.244
different, uh, treatments are
actually functioning from them,

03:50:12.511 --> 03:50:14.511
from like their, their

03:50:15.549 --> 03:50:17.950
experience out. And I bring up
the fortuner again, avid writer

03:50:19.519 --> 03:50:21.754
and also I had the opportunity
to speak to some operators there

03:50:21.855 --> 03:50:24.790
and they're like, I was like,
well, so how effective is this

03:50:24.925 --> 03:50:27.626
red line here? They're like,
yeah, it's hit or MISS Because

03:50:28.361 --> 03:50:30.496
there's tons of cars in the
middle of the lane, so it

03:50:31.432 --> 03:50:34.000
doesn't really, you know, you
still have to swerve and you

03:50:34.535 --> 03:50:36.769
still have to do all these
things. So we'd love to see

03:50:37.738 --> 03:50:40.706
their perspective on like how
the implementation is working
out and what they're seeing

03:50:41.875 --> 03:50:44.844
from, you know, any areas of
improvement that they would see
from their perspective. Again,

03:50:45.379 --> 03:50:48.314
they're the ones that are
actively on these lanes. So we'd

03:50:50.218 --> 03:50:52.819
love to see what they have to
say about it. Yeah that's great.

03:50:52.953 --> 03:50:54.953
We, you know, we meet with them

03:50:54.955 --> 03:50:57.824
once a month at division one
safety meetings. So we get a lot

03:50:58.926 --> 03:51:00.926
of that feedback as well. But we

03:51:01.280 --> 03:51:03.280
should package it and make sure

03:51:05.766 --> 03:51:07.766
we get. Thank you. Sounds good.

03:51:08.937 --> 03:51:11.205
Thank you. Yeah, I just want to
thank you for sharing this sort

03:51:11.906 --> 03:51:14.408
of progression of where we've
been and also just where we're

03:51:15.243 --> 03:51:18.440
going. I really, really love the
vision slide because it helps

03:51:19.347 --> 03:51:22.215
people to understand what all
these little pieces kind of add

03:51:23.617 --> 03:51:25.886
up to this bigger, bigger vision
. So I think the only question I

03:51:26.454 --> 03:51:28.454
have for you is really just

03:51:28.523 --> 03:51:30.457
like, how, how what's it going
to take? How far are we from

03:51:32.930 --> 03:51:34.828
realizing this, this vision? And
what are sort of the big what

03:51:34.996 --> 03:51:36.996
are the big barriers? Yeah,

03:51:37.532 --> 03:51:39.532
there's a lot of barriers from

03:51:40.701 --> 03:51:42.904
technology. You know, signal
that's one of the reasons that

03:51:43.638 --> 03:51:46.340
we want to look at some of our
international peers to figure

03:51:46.575 --> 03:51:48.575
out how better how we can modify

03:51:49.911 --> 03:51:52.713
how we do our signal timing to
better take advantage of, of

03:51:52.914 --> 03:51:54.914
that. You know, when we when you

03:51:55.683 --> 03:51:57.885
look at delay for on average on
a corridor, you know, you get

03:51:59.855 --> 03:52:01.855
like 10, 12% of signal delay.

03:52:03.525 --> 03:52:05.626
Another, you know, 3 to 5% used
to be crowding. But now that

03:52:06.628 --> 03:52:08.796
we've we do all board boarding
and that's really helped reduce

03:52:10.650 --> 03:52:12.650
the dwell time delay. But then

03:52:12.267 --> 03:52:14.502
just the random like congestion
and like we were talking about

03:52:16.505 --> 03:52:18.505
just the competing for space

03:52:18.641 --> 03:52:21.276
with loading and with no, you
know, just double parking and

03:52:22.311 --> 03:52:24.946
people trying to trying to find
parking spots and bike lanes

03:52:25.681 --> 03:52:28.549
and, you know, pedestrian
scrambles all those things eat

03:52:31.820 --> 03:52:33.820
into the travel time. So I the

03:52:35.124 --> 03:52:38.590
vision is laid out there because
you've got to have a vision. If

03:52:38.600 --> 03:52:40.695
we can ever get to that vision.
There's a lot of both. I think

03:52:42.565 --> 03:52:44.399
policy of obstacles as well as
technology obstacles to get

03:52:45.968 --> 03:52:48.269
there. But I think laying out
the vision helps us start

03:52:48.437 --> 03:52:50.437
knocking off some of those and

03:52:51.374 --> 03:52:53.374
finding solutions to some of

03:52:53.543 --> 03:52:55.711
those issues. And that's why
it's kind of a longer term

03:52:57.130 --> 03:52:59.381
vision versus a shorter term, a
shorter term reality. So we're

03:52:59.749 --> 03:53:01.916
going to we're going to keep
bringing you stuff and hopefully

03:53:02.618 --> 03:53:04.619
we can we can keep pushing the
envelope and eventually get

03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:08.189
there. Yeah. And just thank you.
This was this was so

03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:11.961
instructive. Just looking at
this like 12 corridors is two

03:53:12.829 --> 03:53:14.930
thirds of all of our ridership
that it's sort of this

03:53:15.165 --> 03:53:17.165
interesting corollary to of

03:53:17.467 --> 03:53:19.434
course, the vision zero high
injury network, where it's just

03:53:21.700 --> 03:53:23.238
like a small percentage, right.
Covers a huge part of the

03:53:24.173 --> 03:53:26.274
challenge. So I feel like we
should all have those 12 lines

03:53:26.944 --> 03:53:29.678
memorized. I don't know which
ones they are, but that's really

03:53:29.746 --> 03:53:31.746
, really helpful to focus on.

03:53:32.215 --> 03:53:34.550
Focus us in on sort of where the
majority of our ridership is

03:53:34.718 --> 03:53:37.586
taking place. Okay. Are there
any other questions from

03:53:38.688 --> 03:53:40.688
colleagues on the presentation?

03:53:41.291 --> 03:53:43.525
If none, we'll go to public
comment. Please for anyone in

03:53:50.567 --> 03:53:52.567
the room. My board members. Luke

03:53:53.700 --> 03:53:55.700
bornheimer first, I just want to

03:53:56.239 --> 03:53:58.307
thank michael, sean, julie,
director tomlin for all their

03:53:58.375 --> 03:54:00.810
work on muni forward. It's, it's
really great to see and I think

03:54:01.512 --> 03:54:03.780
riders really appreciate it and
it helps move our city towards a

03:54:05.416 --> 03:54:07.416
more sustainable future. Um I

03:54:07.585 --> 03:54:09.585
have a few notes. It would be

03:54:10.540 --> 03:54:12.550
great to see more quick billed
bus boarding islands. I know

03:54:12.523 --> 03:54:14.857
that takes funding, but seeing
those for example, like along

03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:17.920
the 22 on fillmore I think would

03:54:17.394 --> 03:54:19.663
really help to speed up the 22
and also discourage people from

03:54:20.632 --> 03:54:23.467
driving on fillmore and getting
in the way of the 20 to be great

03:54:25.136 --> 03:54:27.237
to see that across the city and
I think voters would support

03:54:27.939 --> 03:54:29.939
that because it would make the

03:54:31.742 --> 03:54:34.444
bus move faster, signal timing.
It would be great to see it on

03:54:34.578 --> 03:54:36.578
both holding green lights and

03:54:37.215 --> 03:54:39.650
preemption. I was on the van the
other day, got caught at a red

03:54:40.452 --> 03:54:42.619
light kind of unnecessarily.
There's no bus stop there, so

03:54:43.354 --> 03:54:46.256
it'd be great to see those
improvements made at brt and on

03:54:48.393 --> 03:54:50.393
the rest of the transit only

03:54:51.829 --> 03:54:54.732
lanes, there was talk about
enforcement. It would be great
to see separation of the transit

03:54:56.501 --> 03:54:58.501
only lanes. So right now it's a

03:54:59.337 --> 03:55:02.390
lot of just like good faith you
know it's either red paint or
white paint. It'd be great to

03:55:02.707 --> 03:55:05.542
see posts curbs. We have bus
lane curbs or even diverters at

03:55:06.111 --> 03:55:08.111
certain intersections to just

03:55:08.213 --> 03:55:10.213
get people off of the streets

03:55:10.582 --> 03:55:12.851
right now it's just too much
good faith and people are just

03:55:12.851 --> 03:55:14.851
not following the rules,

03:55:16.588 --> 03:55:18.689
including on mission. As far as
camera enforcement, I think sean

03:55:20.592 --> 03:55:22.592
was alluding to ab 917 it would

03:55:22.594 --> 03:55:24.662
be great to see that ramped up,
but definitely infrastructure is

03:55:27.165 --> 03:55:29.333
needed. And then as far as the
business impacts, it'd be great

03:55:30.169 --> 03:55:32.169
to see the agency look to new

03:55:32.271 --> 03:55:34.172
york city. New york city has
done a lot of stuff around

03:55:34.773 --> 03:55:36.975
transit only lanes, and maybe
they've done a bunch of business

03:55:37.242 --> 03:55:39.310
impact studies. Not that san
franciscans always like to

03:55:40.212 --> 03:55:42.780
believe other cities. And then
as far as safety, I think

03:55:43.248 --> 03:55:45.750
increased ridership is also
great for safety. And so this

03:55:45.851 --> 03:55:48.520
would encourage that. And
finally, I think I would

03:55:49.550 --> 03:55:51.550
encourage the agency to lean on

03:55:51.290 --> 03:55:53.825
prop j supporters. Prop j prop l
supporters are really correlated

03:55:53.959 --> 03:55:56.861
and I think we can use those
folks to pass measures. Thank

03:55:58.631 --> 03:56:00.631
you. Any other commenters in the

03:56:01.667 --> 03:56:03.801
room? Okay. Please go to remote
at this time. We'll move to

03:56:05.105 --> 03:56:07.172
remote public comment not to
exceed a total time of ten

03:56:07.207 --> 03:56:09.876
minutes. Members of the public
wishing to comment should dial

03:56:09.876 --> 03:56:11.910
star three to enter the queue.
Each speaker will have two

03:56:12.178 --> 03:56:14.178
minutes. Moderator our first

03:56:16.916 --> 03:56:18.916
speaker, this is herbert weiner.

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:21.180
One elephant in the room is the

03:56:22.422 --> 03:56:24.422
need for more expansion of the

03:56:24.991 --> 03:56:26.991
fleet. You need a net addition

03:56:27.460 --> 03:56:30.429
of vehicles, whether they be in
the undergrad and or on the

03:56:31.765 --> 03:56:33.999
surface because this is a
growing popular option with

03:56:34.901 --> 03:56:36.901
growing needs. When you have

03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:39.360
more vehicles, you have more

03:56:39.373 --> 03:56:41.373
frequency of service. And I

03:56:41.875 --> 03:56:43.676
think a lot of the money is
really being wasted on the

03:56:44.811 --> 03:56:46.811
structural improvements like

03:56:48.682 --> 03:56:50.682
eliminating bus stops and other

03:56:52.385 --> 03:56:54.385
other things like that where you

03:56:54.754 --> 03:56:57.190
if you had more busses, you
would have more frequency of

03:56:58.192 --> 03:57:00.192
transportation. There would be

03:57:01.228 --> 03:57:03.563
less crowding and it would be a
much more efficient service and

03:57:05.232 --> 03:57:07.232
you could do it at the same cost

03:57:08.502 --> 03:57:11.270
as the as removing bus stops and
making all these alterations. So

03:57:12.105 --> 03:57:14.105
you must take this into

03:57:14.575 --> 03:57:16.575
consideration. Other wise it

03:57:16.644 --> 03:57:18.644
will perennially have the same

03:57:18.846 --> 03:57:20.846
problem. Thank you. Thank you.

03:57:24.218 --> 03:57:26.218
Next speaker. Good evening.

03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:29.880
Board this is cyrus hall. I'm
calling in today representing a

03:57:30.570 --> 03:57:32.159
faster, safer gary we recently
fought for the approval of the

03:57:32.193 --> 03:57:34.661
gary boulevard improvement
project and we want to thank the

03:57:34.762 --> 03:57:36.730
agency for quickly following
through and delivering the

03:57:37.498 --> 03:57:39.699
project on a tight timeline on
the new transit lane will help

03:57:40.368 --> 03:57:42.669
transit riders for many years to
come and we're excited to see

03:57:42.937 --> 03:57:44.937
the pedestrian improvements

03:57:44.972 --> 03:57:47.173
continue to develop. I want to
emphasize slide three somewhat

03:57:48.409 --> 03:57:51.145
in opposition to the last caller
and staff's presentation on

03:57:51.613 --> 03:57:53.613
congestion, increasing operation

03:57:53.815 --> 03:57:56.517
costs and the opportunity we
have to paint more streets red

03:57:57.919 --> 03:57:59.919
is a relatively cheap option to

03:58:00.210 --> 03:58:02.223
provide wide benefits for riders
and is going to save on

03:58:02.223 --> 03:58:04.223
operational costs associated

03:58:04.759 --> 03:58:07.662
with running the same frequency
of service. This allows us to

03:58:08.463 --> 03:58:10.564
make maximum use of our limited
operating budget additional

03:58:13.100 --> 03:58:15.100
steps to speed up the deployment

03:58:15.700 --> 03:58:17.204
of red lane should be pursued if
available. I also want to note

03:58:17.739 --> 03:58:19.773
that while quick builds have
been very successful for the

03:58:20.542 --> 03:58:22.543
agency and muni, ford has been a
successful program. Project

03:58:23.412 --> 03:58:26.314
integration with other city
departments can be a struggle

03:58:26.515 --> 03:58:28.616
and is a point for continued
improvement on gary. Other

03:58:30.419 --> 03:58:32.419
agencies were unable and unready

03:58:33.550 --> 03:58:34.588
to adjust the positioning of the
seated covered bus stops,

03:58:35.824 --> 03:58:37.824
leaving riders unsure where to

03:58:38.660 --> 03:58:40.761
board busses. This was also a
critical part of getting signal

03:58:40.997 --> 03:58:42.997
timings right. Further

03:58:43.566 --> 03:58:45.467
improvement and cross
cross-department coordination is

03:58:46.302 --> 03:58:48.937
vital as we accelerate these
projects and I encourage the

03:58:49.738 --> 03:58:51.939
board and the agency to continue
to investigate how we can better

03:58:52.941 --> 03:58:54.941
integrate in terms of timing and

03:58:57.813 --> 03:58:59.813
delivery. Thank you. Thank you.

03:59:01.684 --> 03:59:03.785
No additional speakers. Thank
you, secretary silva. We will

03:59:03.853 --> 03:59:06.521
now close public comment. Can
you please call the next item?

03:59:08.570 --> 03:59:10.793
Very good places you on. Item
number 13 present motion and

03:59:11.527 --> 03:59:13.527
discussion regarding the ocean

03:59:31.714 --> 03:59:33.714
view transit and safety project.

03:59:42.325 --> 03:59:45.127
Okay good afternoon, directors.
Once again, michael rhodes,

03:59:45.895 --> 03:59:47.895
transit priority manager for

03:59:49.650 --> 03:59:51.166
sfmta and today I'm giving an
informational update on the

03:59:52.302 --> 03:59:54.302
ocean view transit and safety

03:59:54.705 --> 03:59:57.390
project, which is part of the
muni forward program. And we

03:59:57.875 --> 04:00:00.576
hope to bring the final project
proposal for you for your

04:00:01.945 --> 04:00:04.113
consideration in JANUARY. But
today we'll be sharing a preview

04:00:04.447 --> 04:00:06.447
of what's included and seeking

04:00:07.684 --> 04:00:09.752
your feedback and direction as
we seek to finalize the

04:00:09.954 --> 04:00:12.889
proposals. We don't usually
bring an informational item like

04:00:15.192 --> 04:00:17.860
this prior to approval, but this
project has had a very community

04:00:19.329 --> 04:00:21.931
driven approach to, you know,
design from the very start. And

04:00:22.900 --> 04:00:25.100
we want to make sure we have
time to work through any

04:00:25.235 --> 04:00:27.235
remaining design and outreach

04:00:27.372 --> 04:00:29.606
questions while also getting
your input as we head towards

04:00:34.879 --> 04:00:36.946
the final stage of planning. So
the ocean view, transit and

04:00:37.448 --> 04:00:39.949
safety project is moving
forward. Capital project on the

04:00:40.150 --> 04:00:42.285
line and the ocean view that
aims to improve reliability.

04:00:42.820 --> 04:00:45.722
Customer experience,
accessibility and traffic safety

04:00:47.892 --> 04:00:49.892
as well. All the project area is

04:00:50.461 --> 04:00:53.290
the line in the ocean view
neighborhood, so that's

04:00:53.464 --> 04:00:55.464
basically from the intersection

04:00:56.667 --> 04:00:59.169
of 19th avenue and uniprocessor
boulevard down to balboa park

04:00:59.670 --> 04:01:01.670
station along the so long

04:01:01.873 --> 04:01:04.308
streets like san jose avenue,
broad street, orizaba randolph

04:01:05.543 --> 04:01:07.543
and a section of 19th avenue,

04:01:07.545 --> 04:01:09.480
not the state highway section of
19th avenue, but the section

04:01:09.581 --> 04:01:12.416
that's in the ocean view
neighborhood. And the project

04:01:13.284 --> 04:01:15.284
does not look at sections of the

04:01:15.353 --> 04:01:18.321
line outside of the ocean view
like parkmerced or sf state or

04:01:18.523 --> 04:01:20.523
stonestown or west portal

04:01:20.525 --> 04:01:23.270
avenue. These areas will be
evaluated separately through the

04:01:24.231 --> 04:01:26.231
muni metro modernization study.

04:01:26.398 --> 04:01:28.398
The project would benefit 18,000

04:01:28.433 --> 04:01:30.668
daily riders on the ocean view
and it supports the muni service

04:01:31.403 --> 04:01:34.171
equity strategy. Since the mta
is an equity strategy line and

04:01:34.806 --> 04:01:36.806
the ocean view neighborhood is

04:01:40.946 --> 04:01:42.947
an equity strategy neighborhood.
So broadly speaking, there's

04:01:43.815 --> 04:01:45.815
sort of three main challenges

04:01:45.884 --> 04:01:48.519
that the ocean view, the ocean
view corridor faces within the

04:01:49.688 --> 04:01:51.688
neighborhood of the ocean view.

04:01:51.723 --> 04:01:53.891
There's sort of reliability and
customer experience issues. So

04:01:54.961 --> 04:01:57.629
there's frequent stop signs.
There's a lot of flag stops or

04:01:57.797 --> 04:02:00.640
stops that don't have any kind
of boarding facilities. There

04:02:01.567 --> 04:02:03.835
are closely spaced stops in some
cases and just general

04:02:04.703 --> 04:02:06.703
congestion in some locations

04:02:06.705 --> 04:02:09.407
that can add to the delay. And
in general, transit stops in

04:02:10.800 --> 04:02:12.800
many cases, they basically lack

04:02:12.780 --> 04:02:14.780
sort of basic amenities in terms

04:02:14.681 --> 04:02:16.815
of safety. The project area is
on the city's high injury

04:02:16.916 --> 04:02:18.916
network. Many stops require

04:02:19.318 --> 04:02:20.952
riders to board in the street,
as I mentioned, and ten people

04:02:21.621 --> 04:02:23.621
have been hit in the past five

04:02:24.256 --> 04:02:26.859
years, just sort of getting off
the train. So not not to mention

04:02:26.859 --> 04:02:28.860
all the other pedestrian
injuries. That's that's people

04:02:28.962 --> 04:02:31.960
stepping off the train. As far
as accessibility, there are long

04:02:31.298 --> 04:02:33.365
gaps on this corridor still
between wheelchair accessible

04:02:38.304 --> 04:02:40.304
stops. As I mentioned earlier,

04:02:40.706 --> 04:02:42.774
we've sought to bring in a very
community driven approach to

04:02:43.342 --> 04:02:45.342
outreach on this project. So

04:02:46.146 --> 04:02:48.146
starting in spring summer of

04:02:48.782 --> 04:02:51.584
2022, we began an initial public
outreach phase that was really

04:02:52.190 --> 04:02:54.190
sort of a community listening

04:02:54.621 --> 04:02:56.621
tour. There were no proposals

04:02:57.124 --> 04:02:59.324
yet at this stage. We just went
out to the community and we met

04:02:59.592 --> 04:03:01.593
residents, riders and merchants.
Where they're at. We held a

04:03:02.128 --> 04:03:04.164
survey to identify community
priorities for addressing

04:03:04.164 --> 04:03:06.164
transportation issues. Along the

04:03:06.800 --> 04:03:09.568
corridor. We heard from about
270 survey respondents and a

04:03:09.803 --> 04:03:11.803
majority of the people we heard

04:03:12.139 --> 04:03:14.874
from were people of color. And
23% of the responses that we got

04:03:15.575 --> 04:03:17.575
were provided in chinese in

04:03:19.345 --> 04:03:21.347
summer and fall of 2022. We
shared initial high level

04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:25.318
concepts that sought to address
the top priorities that people

04:03:25.386 --> 04:03:27.821
had identified in the first
phase of outreach. So these

04:03:27.821 --> 04:03:29.821
weren't detailed proposals, but

04:03:30.570 --> 04:03:32.892
rather kind of general concepts
for where we could do things

04:03:33.527 --> 04:03:35.761
like improve safety at stops or
improve travel time through stop

04:03:37.230 --> 04:03:39.499
spacing changes, for instance.
But it's not sort of down to the

04:03:39.600 --> 04:03:41.468
foot level. Here's exactly where
boarding island might be or how

04:03:42.703 --> 04:03:45.372
long it might be in spring of
this year, we shared the first

04:03:45.740 --> 04:03:47.841
round of detailed proposals
based on feedback we'd heard

04:03:48.509 --> 04:03:50.643
during the conceptual phase, and
we gathered more public feedback

04:03:51.679 --> 04:03:54.447
to further refine the proposals
that we presented. And at this

04:03:54.782 --> 04:03:56.817
stage people could see exactly
how transit, how long a transit

04:03:57.519 --> 04:03:59.620
bulb might be. For instance, or
exactly where we might be

04:03:59.954 --> 04:04:01.954
proposing crosswalks with

04:04:02.624 --> 04:04:04.491
continental striping or all the
kind of fine details came out at

04:04:06.930 --> 04:04:08.610
that point. And finally this
summer, most recently in fall,

04:04:08.996 --> 04:04:10.996
we've shared revised proposals

04:04:11.332 --> 04:04:14.201
again that you know, had had
feedback incorporated from that

04:04:14.569 --> 04:04:16.737
last round again. And we held a
public hearing and we briefed

04:04:16.871 --> 04:04:19.673
stakeholders to gather
additional feedback. So there's

04:04:19.807 --> 04:04:22.342
been multiple rounds and really
even the first round reflected

04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:25.145
priorities that we'd identified
through kind of an open

04:04:25.980 --> 04:04:28.181
listening tour of the community.
And now we're just about ready

04:04:28.383 --> 04:04:30.917
to bring a proposal to the mta
board for approval and review.

04:04:32.454 --> 04:04:34.522
But as I mentioned earlier,
there's at least one key

04:04:34.823 --> 04:04:37.124
location where we're continuing
to work with community members

04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:42.429
to finalize the design. And

04:04:42.564 --> 04:04:44.731
here's what we've heard so far
throughout the outreach process.

04:04:45.333 --> 04:04:47.333
During the initial listening

04:04:47.335 --> 04:04:50.105
tour, the number one thing we
heard from survey respondents is

04:04:50.206 --> 04:04:53.174
that muni service should be
faster and more reliable,
consistent with the survey

04:04:53.876 --> 04:04:56.100
results, we saw citywide that
was the priority for responses

04:04:56.945 --> 04:04:59.113
here to that was about two
thirds of responses. Put that as

04:04:59.781 --> 04:05:02.160
their top priority and a quarter
of respondents also said their

04:05:02.718 --> 04:05:04.718
top issue was that transit stops

04:05:05.530 --> 04:05:07.389
don't feel safe for pedestrians
or that they lack basic

04:05:07.390 --> 04:05:09.390
accessibility and, you know,

04:05:10.359 --> 04:05:12.360
other basic amenities. We also
heard consistently that there

04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:15.429
are issues with speeding on san

04:05:15.464 --> 04:05:18.990
jose avenue, kind of similar to
the j church portion of san jose

04:05:18.567 --> 04:05:21.436
avenue. We heard that small
businesses and other community
institutions need parking and

04:05:21.604 --> 04:05:23.604
loading options for people to

04:05:24.474 --> 04:05:26.474
access the corridor. And we

04:05:26.943 --> 04:05:29.645
heard that stunt driving is a
problem at times. On randolph
and broad. Not typically

04:05:29.645 --> 04:05:32.447
something we seek to address
with muni forward, but we were

04:05:32.815 --> 04:05:34.815
listening and we heard that that

04:05:35.117 --> 04:05:37.218
was one of the community issues
that was identified as we began

04:05:38.154 --> 04:05:40.722
to share our initial concepts,
we did hear feedback that
removing train stops at some

04:05:41.425 --> 04:05:43.425
locations would specifically

04:05:44.227 --> 04:05:46.227
orizaba and broad would affect a

04:05:46.463 --> 04:05:48.163
future access to a future
library location. That's

04:05:49.650 --> 04:05:51.333
proposed there. So we said,
okay, we're going to revise that

04:05:52.168 --> 04:05:54.270
to take that into account. What
we heard concerns that proposed

04:05:54.270 --> 04:05:56.270
traffic signals could lead to

04:05:56.339 --> 04:05:58.944
speeding. We also heard some
additional feedback specific to

04:05:58.944 --> 04:06:00.944
the transit stop near the

04:06:01.111 --> 04:06:03.479
salvation army. First nation
corps location on 19th avenue

04:06:04.948 --> 04:06:07.750
that I'll speak to a little bit
more later on and I'll speak to

04:06:07.918 --> 04:06:10.819
some of the changes that we made
based on the feedback a little

04:06:11.421 --> 04:06:13.421
later in the presentation on. So

04:06:14.424 --> 04:06:16.392
here's a summary of what we're
proposing with the current

04:06:17.294 --> 04:06:19.395
proposal. Transit lanes on san
jose avenue from broad to

04:06:21.498 --> 04:06:23.532
niagara to reduce speeding and
to improve transit reliability,

04:06:23.567 --> 04:06:25.567
there's a lot of excess roadway

04:06:25.602 --> 04:06:27.870
capacity right now. So it's
really as much as anything kind

04:06:28.538 --> 04:06:30.806
of a road diet benefit. There
are proposed wider sidewalks and

04:06:32.175 --> 04:06:34.945
boarding islands at 15 train
stops along the corridor to

04:06:35.120 --> 04:06:37.847
provide a safer loading
experience. As we're proposing

04:06:38.649 --> 04:06:40.649
wheelchair accessible ramps at

04:06:40.651 --> 04:06:42.651
four stops to enhance

04:06:42.853 --> 04:06:45.355
accessibility, we're proposing
transit, stop consolidation at

04:06:46.900 --> 04:06:48.791
three locations to reduce, delay
and create more even regular

04:06:49.793 --> 04:06:51.795
stop spacing. We're also
proposing safety elements like

04:06:52.864 --> 04:06:55.532
bulb outs, refuge islands, stop
signs, daylighting continental

04:06:56.601 --> 04:06:59.168
crosswalks and other features to
just generally improve walking

04:07:01.772 --> 04:07:03.772
safety on this corridor. So this

04:07:03.874 --> 04:07:05.874
map summarizes the parking

04:07:06.310 --> 04:07:08.946
changes that would result from
the project improvement. It's as

04:07:09.481 --> 04:07:11.715
you can see, there would be 75
spaces removed in total across

04:07:12.651 --> 04:07:15.619
the corridor, which represents
about 6% of the overall parking

04:07:16.287 --> 04:07:18.755
supply within a block of the
project area, about 94% of

04:07:20.158 --> 04:07:22.827
spaces would be retained. Most
of this parking removal is

04:07:22.827 --> 04:07:25.362
directly tied to safety
improvements. That is pretty

04:07:26.640 --> 04:07:28.632
much all of them. As the table
at the bottom here kind of

04:07:29.568 --> 04:07:31.568
shows, you can list out what the

04:07:32.737 --> 04:07:34.405
benefit of each element is and
how many spaces that would

04:07:35.540 --> 04:07:37.540
require removing to improve

04:07:37.876 --> 04:07:39.910
safety or accessibility or
whatever the benefit is. And

04:07:40.745 --> 04:07:43.613
actually the only element that's
pure transit reliability is stop

04:07:43.815 --> 04:07:46.584
consolidation, which actually
increases the parking supply. So

04:07:48.200 --> 04:07:50.588
as you can see, it's a safety
and reliability that's sort of

04:07:51.556 --> 04:07:53.556
accounts for the lion's share of

04:07:53.959 --> 04:07:56.660
the changes in parking. And one
other important note is that the

04:07:56.694 --> 04:07:59.463
majority of parking changes or
impacts are concentrated at sort

04:08:00.399 --> 04:08:03.201
of outside of the commercial
core of the of the project area.

04:08:04.403 --> 04:08:06.403
So the greatest removal is at

04:08:06.572 --> 04:08:08.673
the ends of the project area and
at the broad san jose

04:08:09.808 --> 04:08:11.909
intersection, which these are
generally not the commercial

04:08:12.978 --> 04:08:15.790
hubs of, of this project area,
although there are still some

04:08:15.614 --> 04:08:17.614
key parking needs, especially on

04:08:17.783 --> 04:08:20.510
the 19th avenue section and some
other locations. So to help

04:08:21.530 --> 04:08:23.389
mitigate the parking impacts, we
did a curb use survey with

04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:25.890
merchants that helped us
identify solution such as

04:08:26.559 --> 04:08:28.493
loading zones that would help
ensure businesses and other

04:08:29.128 --> 04:08:31.463
institutions have their needs
met for parking and loading.

04:08:32.464 --> 04:08:34.766
We've also proposed to add back
parking through angled parking

04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:37.670
and other measures wherever

04:08:39.672 --> 04:08:42.507
feasible near the project area.
Community feedback has shaped

04:08:43.276 --> 04:08:45.444
the project in many ways, both
in terms of the original

04:08:46.345 --> 04:08:49.314
concepts that we presented and
in the revisions that we've made

04:08:50.283 --> 04:08:52.752
over the past year and more. So
first, we've sought to keep

04:08:52.752 --> 04:08:54.787
parking wherever possible. This
has meant proposing shorter

04:08:57.867 --> 04:08:59.525
transit bulbs in some cases as
long as passengers won't be
stepping into an active travel

04:09:01.270 --> 04:09:02.894
lane. So we might propose a
shorter transit bulb as long as

04:09:03.329 --> 04:09:05.397
it's a parking lane there
instead of a travel lane, but

04:09:06.299 --> 04:09:08.500
still trying to at least cover
the first car of the train.

04:09:09.268 --> 04:09:11.360
We've proposed special
intersection treatments to help

04:09:11.805 --> 04:09:13.805
reduce stunt driving at randolph

04:09:13.874 --> 04:09:15.874
on randolph at head in victoria.

04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:18.744
We've implemented or we're
proposing traffic signal timing

04:09:19.746 --> 04:09:21.681
that would maximize safety for
people walking and we're

04:09:22.115 --> 04:09:24.115
considering making the two

04:09:24.250 --> 04:09:27.190
proposed signals all red, kind
of flashing all red at night. So

04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:29.590
they basically function as stop
signs when there's not as much

04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:31.791
transit service running and when
there's not as much traffic. And

04:09:32.860 --> 04:09:34.594
you might see more issues with
speeding. We're also keeping and

04:09:35.529 --> 04:09:38.231
upgrading transit stops at
orizaba broad and bright

04:09:38.799 --> 04:09:40.799
randolph that were originally

04:09:41.168 --> 04:09:43.302
proposed for consolidation and
we also have adjusted some of

04:09:43.470 --> 04:09:45.504
the proposed stop locations to
better serve key community

04:09:45.574 --> 04:09:47.574
institutions and to preserve

04:09:48.142 --> 04:09:50.276
parking where it's needed the
most by businesses, especially

04:09:51.645 --> 04:09:53.645
along 19th avenue. We are

04:09:53.647 --> 04:09:55.649
specifically reducing the
transit bulb length that's

04:09:55.649 --> 04:09:57.649
proposed near the buckman center

04:09:59.119 --> 04:10:01.621
and. Providing a passenger
loading zone there to sort of

04:10:01.955 --> 04:10:04.124
better meet their needs. That
came up during the outreach

04:10:04.826 --> 04:10:06.828
process and we're also looking
to accommodate loading at the

04:10:06.828 --> 04:10:09.730
salvation all nation core
location while upgrading the

04:10:12.466 --> 04:10:14.534
stops as is currently proposed.
So we've made several other

04:10:16.204 --> 04:10:18.304
changes to the project, adding
bulbs, more bulbs and adding

04:10:18.372 --> 04:10:21.242
other pedestrian safety
features. Several other changes.

04:10:21.509 --> 04:10:24.245
I won't list all of them, but
just to know that that project

04:10:24.245 --> 04:10:26.245
has evolved quite a bit through

04:10:29.484 --> 04:10:32.286
the outreach process. So just
briefly, just we'll mention that

04:10:33.621 --> 04:10:35.621
the project does, in addition to

04:10:36.557 --> 04:10:39.260
the in addition to sort of basic
transport features, we are

04:10:39.628 --> 04:10:41.628
looking to incorporate safety

04:10:42.640 --> 04:10:44.640
enhancements like and customer

04:10:44.132 --> 04:10:46.734
experience enhancements. This
this could be things like

04:10:47.702 --> 04:10:49.804
lighting the lighting pilot that
sean mentioned, which will help

04:10:50.205 --> 04:10:52.540
us improve the sense of
security. It stops potentially

04:10:52.540 --> 04:10:55.242
incorporating landscaping,
seating and shelters as other

04:10:56.345 --> 04:10:58.579
elements will ensure that the
project meets a broader range of

04:10:59.414 --> 04:11:02.250
community needs. And in terms of
the details of those proposals,

04:11:02.384 --> 04:11:04.485
that's something we will work
out in close collaboration with

04:11:04.653 --> 04:11:06.653
community during the detailed

04:11:09.791 --> 04:11:11.791
design phase of the project in

04:11:11.793 --> 04:11:14.329
addition to the overview that I
mentioned, I wanted to highlight

04:11:15.364 --> 04:11:18.990
three key locations where we're
proposing the most extensive

04:11:18.734 --> 04:11:20.969
upgrades on the corridor. So
first, this is the intersection

04:11:21.871 --> 04:11:24.406
of broad and san jose. We heard
a lot of feedback about this

04:11:24.406 --> 04:11:26.474
intersection during the
listening tour phase of our

04:11:28.444 --> 04:11:30.478
project outreach. The goal of
this proposal, this intersection

04:11:31.470 --> 04:11:33.382
is to transfer from this
intersection from a freeway

04:11:33.549 --> 04:11:35.650
style off ramp to more of a
walking friendly design. We're

04:11:36.953 --> 04:11:39.621
proposing new pedestrian bulbs
and refuge islands to help

04:11:40.890 --> 04:11:42.890
reduce crossing distances and

04:11:42.291 --> 04:11:44.458
slow traffic. We're also
proposing a new stop sign for

04:11:46.196 --> 04:11:49.970
the northbound san jose avenue
direction to aid pedestrians and

04:11:49.165 --> 04:11:52.101
also trains because trains
actually have to stop and
oncoming traffic doesn't right

04:11:52.602 --> 04:11:54.602
now. So we're looking to correct

04:11:55.380 --> 04:11:57.172
that by making it a four way
stop sign here. At the end

04:11:57.473 --> 04:11:59.674
result should be a great
improvement overall for safety

04:12:01.777 --> 04:12:03.777
here. Another key location is at

04:12:03.946 --> 04:12:06.882
the terminal, stops on san jose
near geneva avenue, right by the

04:12:07.651 --> 04:12:09.618
balboa park station. This
intersection has been the

04:12:11.854 --> 04:12:13.854
subject of planning and studies

04:12:13.924 --> 04:12:16.580
for years and has been a
community priority for upgrades

04:12:16.893 --> 04:12:19.728
for a long, long time. We know
and as you can see in the photos

04:12:20.263 --> 04:12:23.330
here, the existing stops lack
safe boarding areas for, you

04:12:24.135 --> 04:12:26.869
know, all the train doors for
the last outbound stop and for

04:12:27.104 --> 04:12:29.672
some of the train doors for the
inbound stop. In addition, the

04:12:29.673 --> 04:12:31.673
existing wheelchair accessible

04:12:32.642 --> 04:12:34.778
stops here are one of them, is
sort of very inconveniently

04:12:34.778 --> 04:12:36.779
located. And the other
direction, it's not reliable.

04:12:37.614 --> 04:12:39.614
It's mechanical and it breaks

04:12:40.160 --> 04:12:42.618
down all the time. So we're
looking to provide a more

04:12:42.920 --> 04:12:44.920
convenient and reliable

04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:47.991
wheelchair ramp option as well.
So it's been quite a design

04:12:48.192 --> 04:12:50.727
challenge to fit all of the
features that we want to fit

04:12:50.728 --> 04:12:53.396
into this intersection and it's
a busy, constrained zone, but

04:12:54.831 --> 04:12:57.733
this proposal should meet those
needs, we think and greatly
improve conditions for people

04:12:59.370 --> 04:13:01.371
accessing the line. And that is
especially important we think

04:13:02.139 --> 04:13:04.207
right now because there's a
brand new affordable housing

04:13:04.909 --> 04:13:06.709
development that just is sort of
being completed right now or

04:13:07.845 --> 04:13:09.846
just completed on san jose at
this intersection at the

04:13:10.981 --> 04:13:13.182
southwest corner of geneva. So
this these stops are really

04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:16.787
going to better serve that new
community and all the existing

04:13:19.624 --> 04:13:22.426
riders there. So finally, along
the 19th avenue section of the

04:13:23.528 --> 04:13:25.596
project area, the west end of
the project corridor, just

04:13:25.596 --> 04:13:27.596
before sarah, sarah, we're

04:13:28.232 --> 04:13:30.467
seeking to address another of
the most challenging issues with

04:13:31.669 --> 04:13:33.669
the current line service. So as

04:13:34.139 --> 04:13:36.373
you can see in the photo here,
the existing inbound 19th avenue

04:13:38.760 --> 04:13:39.976
stop at sarah does not have a
boarding platform at all and

04:13:40.945 --> 04:13:43.847
passengers are boarding right
into a lane of traffic, not just

04:13:44.315 --> 04:13:46.917
a parking lane, but an active
turn lane for vehicles. So

04:13:48.520 --> 04:13:50.320
drivers there are eager to get
through the traffic signal and

04:13:51.390 --> 04:13:54.159
get onto the state highway
portion of 19th avenue up ahead

04:13:54.159 --> 04:13:56.193
or onto junipero serra
boulevard. And people have been

04:13:56.862 --> 04:13:58.596
hit here. And we've heard from
riders and muni operators that

04:13:59.598 --> 04:14:01.598
improvements are urgently,

04:14:02.401 --> 04:14:04.435
urgently needed. The outbound
stop also lacks a boarding

04:14:05.370 --> 04:14:08.272
island. People board into a
parking lane. So to address

04:14:08.841 --> 04:14:11.776
these issues, we're proposing to
relocate the stops a block to

04:14:12.711 --> 04:14:14.711
the south and upgrade them with

04:14:14.913 --> 04:14:17.348
transit boarding islands. A bike
lane would also be included

04:14:18.450 --> 04:14:20.450
since this part of 19th avenue

04:14:20.652 --> 04:14:23.254
is a bike route that connects
the two sf state and to daly

04:14:25.625 --> 04:14:27.959
city, bart and due to the very
limited geometry and the heavy

04:14:28.895 --> 04:14:30.929
traffic kind of at the existing
stop locations, it wasn't

04:14:31.697 --> 04:14:33.765
possible to upgrade the stops in
their existing locations. So

04:14:35.534 --> 04:14:37.835
we've sought to keep them as
close to the original locations

04:14:38.437 --> 04:14:40.437
as possible while having the

04:14:40.572 --> 04:14:42.574
room to do these upgrades. We're
also proposing to include

04:14:42.709 --> 04:14:45.611
wheelchair accessible ramps to
help fill a lengthy gap in the

04:14:46.746 --> 04:14:48.880
accessible stops right here. And
we've you know, we've heard a

04:14:49.982 --> 04:14:52.840
lot of support and a lot of
urgency for upgrading the

04:14:52.585 --> 04:14:54.686
inbound stop in particular. But
we've also heard concerns about

04:14:55.488 --> 04:14:57.522
some of the potential parking
impacts with this specific

04:14:58.257 --> 04:15:00.257
proposals, especially the

04:15:01.595 --> 04:15:03.595
relocation of the inbound stop

04:15:03.763 --> 04:15:05.763
to block south or so given the

04:15:06.299 --> 04:15:08.700
location of driveways and the
short blocks here and other

04:15:09.502 --> 04:15:11.502
challenges, we're pretty limited

04:15:11.704 --> 04:15:13.705
in where we could place this
upgraded inbound stop in

04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:16.942
particular. But we did want to
share some of the feedback we've

04:15:18.112 --> 04:15:20.112
heard with the board and provide

04:15:20.280 --> 04:15:23.150
an opportunity for discussion on
and just provide, provide you a

04:15:23.583 --> 04:15:25.684
little bit of an update on the
different options and trade offs

04:15:26.486 --> 04:15:28.654
and a little bit of what we're
looking at with the different

04:15:31.491 --> 04:15:34.159
proposals. So on this slide,
we're showing three potential

04:15:35.362 --> 04:15:38.264
designs for the inbound stop on
19th avenue. First, there's the

04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:41.990
current proposal, which we

04:15:41.201 --> 04:15:43.703
already saw that would place the
stop immediately in front of the

04:15:44.771 --> 04:15:47.339
salvation army on 19th avenue,
just south of sergeant street.

04:15:49.276 --> 04:15:51.343
So that's on the left of the
three proposals there. This

04:15:52.480 --> 04:15:55.282
salvation army location is a
church and a service provider.

04:15:55.449 --> 04:15:57.449
It's not a store, but it you

04:15:58.119 --> 04:16:00.190
know, it has a lot of active
services throughout the week.

04:16:00.788 --> 04:16:02.788
And our proposal includes adding

04:16:03.924 --> 04:16:05.959
loading zones to meet the sort
of drop off and access needs.

04:16:06.727 --> 04:16:08.895
But it does put a boarding
island sort of throughout out

04:16:09.960 --> 04:16:11.632
most of the length of their
street frontage on that block.

04:16:13.868 --> 04:16:15.902
They you know, the folks at
salvation army have shared

04:16:16.504 --> 04:16:18.605
concerns about having a transit
stop in front of their

04:16:19.940 --> 04:16:22.909
facilities in general. And we've
also concerns about losing most
of the parking on their block.

04:16:24.780 --> 04:16:26.813
They do have a dedicated parking
lot to the north of sergeant on

04:16:27.281 --> 04:16:29.450
19th avenue, but they've noted
that they do have pretty

04:16:30.118 --> 04:16:32.619
extensive parking demand at
times during services and the

04:16:34.522 --> 04:16:36.924
services that they provide.
Under the first proposal, eight

04:16:37.125 --> 04:16:39.526
out of nine parking spaces on
that block would be removed and

04:16:40.995 --> 04:16:43.930
one blue zone accessible parking
space would be retained on the

04:16:45.567 --> 04:16:48.235
south end. Alternatively there's
sort of two other variants we

04:16:48.303 --> 04:16:50.303
could shorten the boarding

04:16:50.705 --> 04:16:52.705
island to be the length of one

04:16:52.874 --> 04:16:55.309
car instead of a two car train.
Technically, the passengers in

04:16:55.977 --> 04:16:58.780
the second car would step off
into a parking lane, not a

04:16:58.980 --> 04:17:01.515
travel lane. But the lane here
is pretty wide. So, you know,

04:17:03.218 --> 04:17:05.787
there's some risk of a car bike
kind of trying to squeeze past.

04:17:05.787 --> 04:17:07.787
If we don't have the full length

04:17:08.223 --> 04:17:10.258
island here, it's still a huge
improvement over the current

04:17:10.325 --> 04:17:12.259
location where you're stepping
off into an active travel lane,

04:17:13.610 --> 04:17:15.610
of course. And since the current

04:17:15.197 --> 04:17:17.398
location is two lanes, this
one's one. It's an improvement

04:17:17.498 --> 04:17:19.667
in this scenario, the wheelchair
stop would have to be located

04:17:19.667 --> 04:17:21.667
separately, probably north of

04:17:23.139 --> 04:17:26.740
beverly, and this would preserve
for two five parking spaces
instead of just one on the

04:17:27.109 --> 04:17:28.943
block. And finally, on the
right, there's an option where

04:17:29.111 --> 04:17:31.111
we don't build any boarding

04:17:31.680 --> 04:17:33.883
island at the new stop location.
This is the least good in terms

04:17:35.684 --> 04:17:38.386
of safety and accessibility,
although it's certainly still a
major improvement over the

04:17:38.421 --> 04:17:41.290
current stop. We'd still
daylight the front of the stop,

04:17:41.891 --> 04:17:43.925
so there would be some parking
removal, but just about one

04:17:43.960 --> 04:17:46.628
space and we really wouldn't
recommend this design given the

04:17:46.762 --> 04:17:49.431
trade offs for safety and
accessibility that it entails,

04:17:50.366 --> 04:17:53.201
especially given the resolution
telling us to eliminate the

04:17:55.138 --> 04:17:57.339
treatment of flag stops. But we
did want to share this option

04:17:57.774 --> 04:17:59.774
since it does have the least

04:18:01.778 --> 04:18:03.846
parking impact. And finally, we
we've also been in discussion

04:18:03.846 --> 04:18:05.846
with salvation army

04:18:06.315 --> 04:18:09.183
representatives about just in
the last few days about this

04:18:09.285 --> 04:18:11.553
concept of could we move the
stop farther south and maybe

04:18:12.356 --> 04:18:14.590
sort of block the next
intersection with the train stop

04:18:16.960 --> 04:18:19.128
and have a short boarding island
? The second car would actually

04:18:19.462 --> 04:18:21.830
be hanging out into the
monticello intersection. So we

04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:26.340
don't really recommend that that
necessarily unless we completely

04:18:26.350 --> 04:18:27.836
shut down monticello. And
there's sort of circulation

04:18:29.940 --> 04:18:31.940
concerns with doing that and

04:18:31.975 --> 04:18:34.760
feel liability questions. But we
did want to share that. That was

04:18:34.544 --> 04:18:36.746
something that has been brought
up. So we're sharing all of this

04:18:37.714 --> 04:18:39.815
detail to hopefully get the
board's kind of high level

04:18:39.883 --> 04:18:42.118
feedback and direction, maybe
not an inch by inch discussion

04:18:43.987 --> 04:18:45.587
about it, but at least kind of
at the high level of how you

04:18:46.957 --> 04:18:49.193
think we should approach this
and what to prioritize near this

04:18:49.193 --> 04:18:51.828
intersection ahead of bringing
this back to you. Hopefully for

04:18:52.620 --> 04:18:54.897
a final vote in JANUARY for the
whole project. But in the

04:18:54.898 --> 04:18:57.400
meantime, we will be continuing
to work closely with salvation

04:18:57.601 --> 04:18:59.702
army folks and try to
accommodate their needs as best

04:19:00.904 --> 04:19:03.205
as possible in this proposal,
but instead of just waiting till

04:19:03.706 --> 04:19:06.376
JANUARY, we did want to share an
update and sort of get at least

04:19:06.611 --> 04:19:08.611
your kind of high level feedback

04:19:08.613 --> 04:19:10.613
on this. So wrapping up or the

04:19:11.148 --> 04:19:13.182
next steps look like today,
informational item giving you

04:19:13.751 --> 04:19:15.751
this update outreach continues

04:19:15.753 --> 04:19:18.688
JANUARY bringing this project
for a vote. Hopefully spring

04:19:18.822 --> 04:19:21.557
quick build of the initial
improvements, detailed design

04:19:22.894 --> 04:19:24.895
over the next couple of years
and then full construction in

04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:28.432
2026 to 2028. But again, trying
to get many of the benefits as

04:19:31.402 --> 04:19:33.402
soon as this spring, this is the

04:19:33.971 --> 04:19:35.672
package that you will be voting
on essentially in the coming

04:19:38.976 --> 04:19:41.450
months. And you know, that's
that's pretty much the update.

04:19:41.313 --> 04:19:43.847
Thank you, directors. We're
happy to answer any questions

04:19:43.915 --> 04:19:45.606
today. We look forward to
getting your input on the

04:19:46.718 --> 04:19:48.785
project and work towards work
towards finalizing this last key

04:19:48.887 --> 04:19:51.722
piece of the proposed design.
Thank you so much. Vice chair

04:19:54.425 --> 04:19:56.425
kahina. Um, I'm excited about

04:19:57.830 --> 04:20:00.310
this project for many reasons. I
think this is a commercial

04:20:01.400 --> 04:20:03.400
corridor that has really wanted

04:20:03.702 --> 04:20:05.702
this level of investment for a

04:20:05.837 --> 04:20:07.837
long period of time and it's so

04:20:07.839 --> 04:20:09.839
great to be able to be to serve

04:20:09.841 --> 04:20:12.542
on this board and be in a place,
in a position to be able to give

04:20:14.545 --> 04:20:17.181
this sort of investment to this
neighborhood that desperately
needs it just for context, for

04:20:17.249 --> 04:20:19.283
my colleagues to better
understand what this corridor is

04:20:20.385 --> 04:20:22.753
like and some of the challenges
that it has had. It is a

04:20:24.957 --> 04:20:26.957
corridor that has pockets of

04:20:27.920 --> 04:20:29.293
commercial activity throughout
it. It's not a commercial

04:20:29.995 --> 04:20:31.995
corridor that, you know, it's

04:20:33.399 --> 04:20:35.567
not as robust as ocean avenue or
or the mission street excelsior

04:20:36.836 --> 04:20:38.836
corridor, but it is one that has

04:20:39.905 --> 04:20:41.939
had a lot of I would say,
community power to really

04:20:42.708 --> 04:20:44.708
activate it for a long period of

04:20:45.511 --> 04:20:47.511
time. And there are certain

04:20:48.514 --> 04:20:50.750
intersections that have had a
lot of intervention from

04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:52.918
infested neighborhoods, from
other different departments in

04:20:54.687 --> 04:20:56.822
the city to support it and to
make sure that beautification

04:20:58.424 --> 04:21:00.424
projects happen and all these

04:21:01.861 --> 04:21:03.861
different things. So. There's a

04:21:04.163 --> 04:21:06.264
couple of things that I'm noting
in this particular project that

04:21:07.300 --> 04:21:09.300
I have questions about. Some are

04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:11.469
around the bookends. So on the

04:21:13.906 --> 04:21:16.575
geneva to san jose side,
michael's right. There's a new

04:21:16.676 --> 04:21:19.440
development there that just went
up. It's now the ribbon cutting

04:21:19.779 --> 04:21:21.779
ceremony happened. It's up and

04:21:22.348 --> 04:21:24.348
running and it's a beautiful

04:21:24.685 --> 04:21:26.685
sight. Right? 100% affordable

04:21:29.220 --> 04:21:31.857
housing, a huge collaboration
with bart occurred in that space

04:21:32.259 --> 04:21:34.259
to improve the bart plaza

04:21:36.829 --> 04:21:38.829
location. Um it is a place where

04:21:40.533 --> 04:21:42.533
a lot of folks, you know, start

04:21:42.536 --> 04:21:44.536
their, you know, their trips on

04:21:44.638 --> 04:21:47.506
bart and oftentimes, you know, a
lot of folks there isn't a

04:21:48.108 --> 04:21:50.108
parking structure around there

04:21:51.411 --> 04:21:53.411
so and this neighborhood is very

04:21:53.447 --> 04:21:55.781
car centric. And so a lot of
folks do park adjacent or near

04:21:58.685 --> 04:22:01.488
the balboa park station to drop
their cars off and then be able

04:22:02.890 --> 04:22:04.890
to take transit from there. Um,

04:22:05.250 --> 04:22:07.250
so I see the loss of parking

04:22:07.161 --> 04:22:09.161
here and it gives me a little

04:22:09.330 --> 04:22:11.965
bit of a concern on I'm just to
knowing how the community uses

04:22:11.965 --> 04:22:13.965
this space and knowing how they

04:22:14.201 --> 04:22:16.836
use the parking facilities that
are currently there right now.

04:22:17.572 --> 04:22:20.440
But I agree it is a design
challenge. It's a bit of a mess

04:22:21.742 --> 04:22:23.742
there for many reasons. Um, and

04:22:24.312 --> 04:22:27.247
it is challenging for transit
riders to be able to take to

04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:31.349
board the muni, to board muni

04:22:32.519 --> 04:22:35.388
and whether it's the bus or a
train, it's been challenging for

04:22:37.725 --> 04:22:40.661
some time. Um, so I'm curious to
see like what the conversation

04:22:40.895 --> 04:22:42.895
has been with the community on

04:22:43.498 --> 04:22:45.498
the loss of parking there and,

04:22:45.633 --> 04:22:47.633
and really trying to understand

04:22:48.603 --> 04:22:50.470
what the discussion has been in
some of the solutions that have

04:22:50.638 --> 04:22:52.638
popped up in that particular

04:22:53.575 --> 04:22:55.575
section in just again, I just

04:22:55.577 --> 04:22:57.577
know that a lot of folks really

04:22:57.745 --> 04:22:59.745
park and ride in that that area.

04:23:01.583 --> 04:23:04.384
And that's how they use it. So
I'm curious about that. The

04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:07.520
other part that I'm just super

04:23:07.655 --> 04:23:09.655
enthusiastic about is the broad

04:23:09.758 --> 04:23:11.859
san jose interchange there,
because I do again, that's

04:23:11.994 --> 04:23:13.994
another tricky intersection and

04:23:15.197 --> 04:23:17.833
I'm glad that there's going to
be a four way stop there. It's

04:23:17.833 --> 04:23:20.667
been needed for some time. So I
think that's great. Um I am

04:23:23.638 --> 04:23:25.639
interested in understanding you
mentioned like this, this

04:23:26.408 --> 04:23:28.943
project could be an opportunity
to also integrate some public

04:23:29.845 --> 04:23:32.647
realm improvements. I'm
wondering if those are funded in

04:23:34.316 --> 04:23:37.190
the project or if this is
something where you'd have to

04:23:37.190 --> 04:23:39.754
collaborate with another
department or just want to
understand that piece of it

04:23:40.622 --> 04:23:42.622
because there have like what I

04:23:42.824 --> 04:23:45.495
don't want folks to members of
the community to expect to see

04:23:45.495 --> 04:23:47.495
public realm improvements as

04:23:48.164 --> 04:23:50.465
part of the project and then get
disappoint when we're just, you

04:23:52.301 --> 04:23:53.868
know, implementing some of our
infrastructure improvements

04:23:55.537 --> 04:23:57.537
around transit. So that piece as

04:23:57.640 --> 04:23:59.640
well. But yes, if you could

04:24:00.909 --> 04:24:02.909
answer to those three questions

04:24:03.446 --> 04:24:05.446
as specifically around the

04:24:07.150 --> 04:24:09.150
geneva san jose intersection,

04:24:09.351 --> 04:24:11.351
the public realm improvements

04:24:12.540 --> 04:24:14.540
and just understanding a little

04:24:14.290 --> 04:24:16.290
bit more on what the appetite

04:24:17.126 --> 04:24:19.427
has been on from the community
on the loss of parking, because

04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:22.830
I know that's that's something

04:24:22.899 --> 04:24:25.501
that this community in
particular is going to feel

04:24:27.203 --> 04:24:29.203
really, really strongly against.

04:24:30.240 --> 04:24:33.175
Yeah thank you, director. So in
terms of the geneva san jose

04:24:34.110 --> 04:24:36.978
area overall, we've heard pretty
strong support for the

04:24:37.113 --> 04:24:39.415
improvements. I think there's an
understanding that excuse me,

04:24:40.183 --> 04:24:42.885
that, you know, it's just an
area where there's been this

04:24:43.920 --> 04:24:46.822
long standing need and the
parking impact is significant at

04:24:48.291 --> 04:24:50.626
that location. But I think
everything we've heard working

04:24:50.693 --> 04:24:52.693
with community members there has

04:24:53.730 --> 04:24:55.730
been overall supportive. We have

04:24:56.567 --> 04:24:59.302
designed it in a way that
provides the key benefits with

04:25:00.237 --> 04:25:02.237
as little parking impact as you

04:25:03.373 --> 04:25:05.541
can manage. And even some of the
adjustments to it preserve more

04:25:06.276 --> 04:25:09.450
of the parking that's closest to
balboa park station, just

04:25:09.312 --> 04:25:11.312
through sort of reconfigure ing

04:25:11.848 --> 04:25:14.584
some of the design at the same
time, those changes have
probably benefited the project

04:25:16.320 --> 04:25:18.320
overall. So I think luckily we

04:25:18.522 --> 04:25:20.522
were able to find a design that

04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:22.725
is best from an accessibility
standpoint, best from a transit

04:25:23.160 --> 04:25:25.862
rider standpoint and does the
least to remove parking. But

04:25:25.963 --> 04:25:27.897
there's no avoiding that there,
is there is, you know,

04:25:27.965 --> 04:25:29.965
significant amount of parking

04:25:30.680 --> 04:25:32.970
impact. But I would say we have
not at that particular location,

04:25:32.970 --> 04:25:34.970
heard a great deal of concern.

04:25:35.640 --> 04:25:37.640
We've heard it more kind of

04:25:37.642 --> 04:25:39.642
right in front of merchant

04:25:39.844 --> 04:25:41.844
locations along the corridor in

04:25:43.581 --> 04:25:46.449
general, as far as the public
realm improvements, I think some

04:25:46.450 --> 04:25:49.420
basic public realm improvements
should be able to be addressed

04:25:50.880 --> 04:25:52.256
within the project. The lighting
pilot that I mentioned is funded

04:25:53.391 --> 04:25:56.326
through a separate a separate
pilot program at the same time,

04:25:56.928 --> 04:25:58.862
if we get into detail design and
we're having community

04:25:59.330 --> 04:26:01.932
conversations where people want
things that are beyond what we

04:26:02.199 --> 04:26:05.168
can fund, then I think we would
take initiative as a project to

04:26:06.400 --> 04:26:08.239
do everything we can to try to
make that happen. But it

04:26:09.241 --> 04:26:11.675
probably l taraval is a good
example of the kind of basic

04:26:12.978 --> 04:26:14.978
sort of landscaping customer
experience elements that we've

04:26:15.647 --> 04:26:18.549
been able to incorporate into
the first phase of that. And it

04:26:19.840 --> 04:26:20.784
looks great if you've been out
to taraval street, the boarding

04:26:21.519 --> 04:26:24.220
islands are not just a slabs of
concrete. There architecturally

04:26:25.124 --> 04:26:28.590
nice and have some landscaping
elements. So at a minimum, I

04:26:28.160 --> 04:26:30.270
think that level would be
something we can incorporate

04:26:32.364 --> 04:26:34.364
with the current budget. Then a

04:26:36.368 --> 04:26:38.368
follow up question I had because

04:26:38.370 --> 04:26:40.370
because again, this corridor has

04:26:40.372 --> 04:26:42.372
pockets of commercial activity

04:26:42.741 --> 04:26:44.843
and I understand that we're
going to integrate transit only

04:26:46.612 --> 04:26:49.480
lanes as part of the project.
Have there been some strong

04:26:49.481 --> 04:26:52.160
feelings from the community
about opposing the transit only

04:26:52.784 --> 04:26:54.784
lanes along the commercial

04:26:55.530 --> 04:26:57.989
corridor or like just if you can
give me a sense of what the

04:26:57.990 --> 04:27:00.959
community response has been,
that'd be great. Sure. Yeah. So

04:27:01.600 --> 04:27:03.261
the transit lanes are only
proposed on san jose avenue,

04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:06.230
which in this segment is like
100% residential all so we

04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:11.200
really haven't had any concern
about it. It's such a low volume

04:27:11.804 --> 04:27:13.905
street for the width of the
street. Left turns are still

04:27:15.308 --> 04:27:18.210
allowed. There's no kind of
business impact or business

04:27:18.344 --> 04:27:21.312
access issues, so it, you know,
it can be a it can be something

04:27:21.614 --> 04:27:24.483
that's a point of discussion
with projects. But in this case,

04:27:25.384 --> 04:27:27.384
it has not been a concern that

04:27:29.221 --> 04:27:31.221
we've heard. Okay. And in terms

04:27:33.159 --> 04:27:36.950
of I hear you wanting guidance
from us on the three different

04:27:37.764 --> 04:27:39.764
options that you have there. And

04:27:42.202 --> 04:27:44.202
I, I would honestly defer to

04:27:44.737 --> 04:27:46.805
your work with the community to
understand what's best for folks

04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:51.910
there. Um, I think it's

04:27:55.615 --> 04:27:57.716
important to try to there are a
lot of seniors in this

04:27:59.653 --> 04:28:01.653
neighborhood as well. And so I,

04:28:03.623 --> 04:28:05.623
I do want to prioritize the

04:28:06.126 --> 04:28:08.126
resources that ensure that they

04:28:08.162 --> 04:28:10.963
still have close proximity to a
lot of the resources along the

04:28:14.680 --> 04:28:15.868
corridor. And it seems like this
particular intersection is one

04:28:16.403 --> 04:28:18.403
of those that converge a lot of

04:28:18.471 --> 04:28:20.471
different resource hubs for

04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:25.212
folks. And so we'll defer to
staff and community to work it

04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:30.950
out. And so I but I, I hope that

04:28:33.153 --> 04:28:35.221
in the discussions, um, we do
communicate to the community how

04:28:35.889 --> 04:28:37.889
important it is for seniors to

04:28:39.226 --> 04:28:41.226
also to safely board the transit

04:28:43.264 --> 04:28:46.133
as well. Um, and that that's not
lost in the discussion. So

04:28:48.336 --> 04:28:50.937
that's, I guess it's not really
a lot of clear direction on it,

04:28:51.472 --> 04:28:53.472
but just wanted to give you my,

04:28:53.674 --> 04:28:55.674
my sense of how you all should

04:28:56.276 --> 04:28:58.878
tackle it. Thank you. Vice chair
karina, director. So, and kensi,

04:28:59.460 --> 04:29:01.949
I see your hands are raised
also. So we have a number of

04:29:02.751 --> 04:29:04.985
members of the public who would
like to comment on this item. So

04:29:05.787 --> 04:29:07.954
if that's okay with you, I'd
like to go to public comment

04:29:08.723 --> 04:29:10.958
now, hear from the public, and
then we can have further

04:29:10.958 --> 04:29:12.958
discussion of the board. Please

04:29:13.600 --> 04:29:15.262
please go ahead and approach the
podium. If you'd like to comment

04:29:17.632 --> 04:29:19.632
on this item. Oh, good evening,

04:29:23.371 --> 04:29:25.371
MADAM Chair and mta directors.

04:29:27.242 --> 04:29:30.177
my name is jeannie tam. I have
been a member of the salvation

04:29:30.745 --> 04:29:32.745
army church for 35 years and I

04:29:33.881 --> 04:29:36.717
am currently on the church corps
council and I have with me we

04:29:39.288 --> 04:29:41.989
had our senior pastor who had to
leave and we have our assistant

04:29:42.691 --> 04:29:44.892
pastor and we have some members
here as you could tell, we're

04:29:45.600 --> 04:29:47.628
not board meeting savvy because
we've been here since 1:00, even

04:29:48.163 --> 04:29:50.163
though we knew our agenda was

04:29:52.968 --> 04:29:54.968
last. So our I understand that

04:29:58.107 --> 04:30:00.108
the proposal proposal is to do a
accommodate two different stops

04:30:01.677 --> 04:30:04.579
near us and to make that into
one right in front of our church

04:30:05.470 --> 04:30:07.648
entrance is it's literally just
a few yards away from our front

04:30:09.919 --> 04:30:11.919
door. We are called td center

04:30:14.824 --> 04:30:16.791
for worship and service. We are
registered 150 member church

04:30:17.293 --> 04:30:19.293
wednesday evenings, sunday

04:30:19.629 --> 04:30:21.629
mornings we gather, and it's

04:30:21.664 --> 04:30:23.664
already at parking challenge for

04:30:24.133 --> 04:30:26.734
us on the picture looked like
they are partial cross street

04:30:28.338 --> 04:30:30.338
looked much bigger. It's only

04:30:30.807 --> 04:30:33.642
ten spots a parcel so we already
have to look for scatter to look

04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:35.910
for other parking spots within

04:30:35.978 --> 04:30:38.413
the streets. And we call our
service service center because

04:30:39.515 --> 04:30:41.515
we service our our local low

04:30:43.519 --> 04:30:46.188
income families. We serve as
weekly food pantry where 70

04:30:46.323 --> 04:30:48.323
people, individuals line up to

04:30:48.391 --> 04:30:50.391
pick up their groceries and we

04:30:50.393 --> 04:30:52.761
have clothing drive on
wednesdays. We have women coming

04:30:53.330 --> 04:30:55.330
to pick up their clothes from

04:30:55.465 --> 04:30:57.465
our room full of clothing. At

04:30:57.734 --> 04:30:59.801
and seasonal programs like
summer bible school programs for

04:31:00.536 --> 04:31:03.172
youth, youth. And we have back
to school backpack handing out

04:31:05.108 --> 04:31:07.343
backpacks an angel tree and
christmas and we're they pick up

04:31:09.679 --> 04:31:11.679
we so as you can see we can we

04:31:12.148 --> 04:31:14.148
have constant flow of people

04:31:14.317 --> 04:31:16.785
coming in to register and sign
up for things. We have constant

04:31:17.887 --> 04:31:19.887
flow of loading, unloading

04:31:20.691 --> 04:31:23.393
supplies. So at our front door
entrance is the primary access

04:31:24.194 --> 04:31:26.930
pause for one minute. That is
your time. However, are you

04:31:26.930 --> 04:31:29.465
speaking on behalf of a number
of. Yes, I am. There's only

04:31:29.633 --> 04:31:31.633
maybe two people behind me who's

04:31:31.635 --> 04:31:33.704
going to speak. Is that all
right? If we allow additional

04:31:33.704 --> 04:31:36.638
time, if she's speaking on
behalf of other people? If you

04:31:36.874 --> 04:31:39.676
have, I'm almost done. Yeah. If
you have questions for the

04:31:39.911 --> 04:31:41.911
speaker, she can respond to any.

04:31:42.646 --> 04:31:44.646
Okay okay. So taking away even a

04:31:44.715 --> 04:31:46.715
small percentage of parking will

04:31:47.251 --> 04:31:50.860
really have huge impact for our
daily operation. And we do

04:31:51.221 --> 04:31:53.790
understand and appreciate the
objective of this project, which

04:31:54.926 --> 04:31:57.894
for the safety and writing
enhanced ridership enhancement.

04:32:00.932 --> 04:32:03.733
However we and we're grateful
for these additional alternate

04:32:05.302 --> 04:32:07.437
lives, but we would please would
like to ask if you could

04:32:07.872 --> 04:32:09.872
possibly move the stop to any

04:32:11.308 --> 04:32:13.811
other block or and again, it's
literally an important

04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:17.790
impairment of our daily

04:32:17.148 --> 04:32:19.148
operations loading, unloading

04:32:19.217 --> 04:32:21.217
passengers. We do have many few

04:32:22.153 --> 04:32:24.621
handicapped persons who have to
really get off really in front

04:32:26.230 --> 04:32:28.910
of our door instead of walking
halfway. Block thank you for

04:32:28.292 --> 04:32:30.595
your time. Thank you. Are there
additional speakers in the room

04:32:37.869 --> 04:32:40.637
on this item? Please go ahead.
Good evening. Board my name is

04:32:41.606 --> 04:32:44.740
steve tam. I'm also with the san
francisco all-nations core. I

04:32:45.543 --> 04:32:47.979
just wanted to elaborate that
additionally to what jeannie had

04:32:49.181 --> 04:32:51.181
said. Right. You know, we have a

04:32:52.170 --> 04:32:54.718
service. You know, we have a lot
of numbers. Right. But what she

04:32:54.753 --> 04:32:56.753
didn't say is that the access to

04:32:58.623 --> 04:33:00.757
our block right in that block,
if you compare to all other

04:33:01.426 --> 04:33:03.426
blocks, we have a continuous

04:33:03.562 --> 04:33:05.562
block on our side and as well as

04:33:05.765 --> 04:33:08.566
on the other side. On the other,
on the opposite side of the

04:33:09.340 --> 04:33:11.636
street there aren't small spaces
that you can never park a car,

04:33:11.636 --> 04:33:14.338
right? That's why you've got ten
plus eight and then looks like

04:33:14.473 --> 04:33:16.473
another two based off of their

04:33:17.576 --> 04:33:19.576
current. That's 20 spaces, right

04:33:20.178 --> 04:33:22.178
? That makes up over 26% of what

04:33:22.582 --> 04:33:24.582
they just indicated as the 75,

04:33:25.284 --> 04:33:27.452
75 spaces throughout the whole
line. Right. So that's a major

04:33:28.854 --> 04:33:30.854
impact on us, right. But having

04:33:32.525 --> 04:33:34.626
access for the parents to drop
off their youth or, you know,

04:33:37.620 --> 04:33:40.320
just for people have access,
handicap access challenge, we

04:33:41.134 --> 04:33:43.134
need to have access on our side

04:33:43.236 --> 04:33:46.171
of the street at a minimum.
Right. For their safety. So I

04:33:47.140 --> 04:33:49.140
understand the stops that are

04:33:49.742 --> 04:33:51.742
necessary for the passengers,

04:33:51.777 --> 04:33:54.613
for the muni, but we also have
to consider the safety of the

04:33:56.483 --> 04:33:58.483
community that comes to our

04:33:58.985 --> 04:34:00.985
church for all the services and

04:34:01.154 --> 04:34:03.856
other things. Right. So I did
notice that, you know, on the

04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:05.990
powerpoint that we saw, there

04:34:07.594 --> 04:34:09.728
was only the proposal alternate
one and two, alternative three,

04:34:12.980 --> 04:34:14.980
which was shown just now, which

04:34:14.902 --> 04:34:16.902
is showing the stop on the south

04:34:17.837 --> 04:34:19.837
end of the stop. That would in

04:34:20.107 --> 04:34:22.107
corrupt the monticello street.

04:34:22.442 --> 04:34:25.277
That's a very low usage street.
Right and but you know because

04:34:26.212 --> 04:34:28.212
our block is triangle, the two

04:34:28.214 --> 04:34:30.214
sides are very you know angled

04:34:32.186 --> 04:34:34.186
right having having a train stop

04:34:34.855 --> 04:34:37.230
there also prevents people from
speeding down that hill. Right.

04:34:39.259 --> 04:34:41.259
So you know, but the main point

04:34:41.662 --> 04:34:43.662
is the criticality of just

04:34:43.664 --> 04:34:46.398
maintaining our block on that
side of the street. Okay thank

04:34:46.867 --> 04:34:48.867
you for your time. Thank you.

04:34:54.575 --> 04:34:57.510
Additional speakers. Good
evening all for the directors.

04:34:59.246 --> 04:35:02.480
And I am sorry you guys have to
stay late. My name is chong

04:35:03.984 --> 04:35:06.853
park. I'm the pastor and I'm
talking about the, you know, we

04:35:07.622 --> 04:35:09.622
have also a senior citizens over

04:35:09.824 --> 04:35:11.824
there and the handicapped and

04:35:12.260 --> 04:35:14.260
also children's. You guys have

04:35:15.296 --> 04:35:17.296
to consider that if they want to

04:35:18.232 --> 04:35:20.967
looking for safety, which is not
good front of the church and

04:35:23.504 --> 04:35:25.504
parking not yes we do need

04:35:25.807 --> 04:35:27.807
parking but mostly important

04:35:29.277 --> 04:35:31.277
people who are able to walk.

04:35:31.879 --> 04:35:34.348
Disability peoples. That's very
important to walk through the

04:35:35.216 --> 04:35:37.216
think about it. You know,

04:35:38.786 --> 04:35:40.786
eventually they cannot walk. And

04:35:41.155 --> 04:35:43.155
especially I have a husband who

04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:46.590
have a 23 years and straw hemi

04:35:46.761 --> 04:35:48.761
paradise and he can walk and he

04:35:49.431 --> 04:35:51.431
can get out and I have to take

04:35:52.500 --> 04:35:54.500
him out. But he he loved to come

04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:57.670
to church, you know, so I was

04:35:58.600 --> 04:36:00.600
nearly abducted. So if they can

04:36:00.876 --> 04:36:02.876
move to a different place, the

04:36:05.130 --> 04:36:07.748
stop different place, which is
better also, they sierra and

04:36:10.118 --> 04:36:12.118
which they have last accident I

04:36:14.890 --> 04:36:16.590
also rejected the place because
the stop sign is too short you

04:36:18.427 --> 04:36:20.427
know so that's why you know,

04:36:23.699 --> 04:36:25.699
cars are so speed way to come to

04:36:26.635 --> 04:36:28.635
19 to 1 one I guess I would one

04:36:28.937 --> 04:36:31.739
that's the problem. Another
thing is that you know I've been

04:36:34.377 --> 04:36:36.945
research the trend not many
people get out of their place

04:36:39.682 --> 04:36:41.682
only 2 or 3 people I've been

04:36:42.118 --> 04:36:44.118
such the seven days because of

04:36:45.521 --> 04:36:47.521
this. And you know they bike

04:36:48.457 --> 04:36:50.457
people. They don't have it. And

04:36:51.561 --> 04:36:53.561
I want you guys nearly survey

04:36:55.698 --> 04:36:58.667
again to move to another area to
the parking space please if you

04:36:59.602 --> 04:37:01.602
can. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

04:37:01.604 --> 04:37:04.372
Thank you for your comment. Any
other speakers in the room on

04:37:07.443 --> 04:37:09.443
this item? No additional

04:37:09.746 --> 04:37:11.746
speakers. Okay please open the

04:37:12.382 --> 04:37:15.150
remote comment at this time.
We'll move to remote public

04:37:15.318 --> 04:37:17.654
comment not to exceed a time of
ten minutes. Members of the

04:37:17.654 --> 04:37:19.755
public wishing to comment should
dial star three to enter the

04:37:20.457 --> 04:37:22.457
queue. Each speaker will have
two minutes. Moderator first

04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:29.310
speaker is evening board. This
is cyrus hall. I just want to

04:37:29.166 --> 04:37:31.300
voice my strong support for the
ocean view transit and safety

04:37:32.102 --> 04:37:34.603
project. I've reviewed this
project and communicated quite a

04:37:34.805 --> 04:37:37.606
bit with the agency and while I
would love to have seen more two

04:37:38.509 --> 04:37:40.509
car islands, I think the agency

04:37:40.543 --> 04:37:43.312
has really made some some good
and difficult decisions around
balancing street geometries and

04:37:44.982 --> 04:37:47.116
community use decisions. But
within that context, I want to

04:37:48.285 --> 04:37:50.285
strongly urge the agency to

04:37:50.354 --> 04:37:52.354
adopt the original proposal at

04:37:52.623 --> 04:37:54.824
19th and randolph street, we do
not often get opportunities to

04:37:55.826 --> 04:37:58.560
improve muni lines and passing
the opportunity to create a two

04:37:58.729 --> 04:38:00.729
car island for riders would be

04:38:00.897 --> 04:38:03.200
deeply unfortunate. Shortening
the island would force riders on

04:38:04.168 --> 04:38:06.803
the second car to step into the
traffic lane. And while traffic

04:38:07.872 --> 04:38:10.106
should be slowing, if a train is
in the stop, it would have to

04:38:10.741 --> 04:38:13.643
wait as they would have to wait
for the train to clear. It still

04:38:13.911 --> 04:38:15.911
adds risks and difficult for

04:38:16.113 --> 04:38:18.113
riders removing the island

04:38:18.315 --> 04:38:21.510
entirely is wholly unacceptable.
While we are struggling to make

04:38:21.452 --> 04:38:23.820
progress on vision zero and we
must not MISS This opportunity

04:38:25.156 --> 04:38:27.156
to remove a clear traffic hazard

04:38:27.425 --> 04:38:30.127
for riders, we need to be
encouraging the use of public

04:38:30.127 --> 04:38:32.127
transit, not continuing to

04:38:32.263 --> 04:38:34.731
accept a car first mindset as a
city, many senior citizens

04:38:34.965 --> 04:38:37.701
cannot drive. Children can't
drive many differently abled

04:38:38.536 --> 04:38:40.604
people can't drive. And making
muni easier and convenient to

04:38:41.806 --> 04:38:43.806
use is vital to serve those

04:38:44.242 --> 04:38:46.420
riders. I also want to mention
that moving the wheelchair

04:38:46.544 --> 04:38:48.544
accessible ramp would push

04:38:48.579 --> 04:38:51.382
wheelchair users away from the
rest of waiting passengers,

04:38:51.382 --> 04:38:53.382
increasing their perceptions of

04:38:53.484 --> 04:38:55.484
risk while riding. It would also

04:38:55.621 --> 04:38:58.422
make boarding and egress slower
as the m would have to stop

04:38:58.857 --> 04:39:00.857
twice. Thank you very much.

04:39:01.593 --> 04:39:03.593
Thank you. Thank you. No

04:39:04.290 --> 04:39:06.290
additional speakers. Okay. Thank

04:39:07.899 --> 04:39:09.899
you, director. So please. Um.

04:39:10.435 --> 04:39:12.537
Thank you for the presentations
and thank you for all these

04:39:15.307 --> 04:39:17.542
public comments. I'd like to ask
to clarify just my understanding

04:39:19.770 --> 04:39:21.770
of the extent of the scope of

04:39:21.246 --> 04:39:23.246
the work here. Are you upgrading

04:39:26.985 --> 04:39:28.985
the tracks as well. Director so

04:39:29.155 --> 04:39:31.890
no. This project currently would
just be focused on the transit

04:39:32.792 --> 04:39:35.360
reliability and pedestrian
safety elements. There's not

04:39:36.929 --> 04:39:39.697
currently a plan to incorporate
track replacement as part of it.

04:39:40.933 --> 04:39:42.933
Okay. Thank you. And then also,

04:39:43.302 --> 04:39:45.937
did you check with other
agencies like our friends and

04:39:46.873 --> 04:39:48.873
like, for example, puc, if there

04:39:49.608 --> 04:39:51.608
will be also doing work along

04:39:54.614 --> 04:39:56.614
this route? Great question. Yes

04:39:56.949 --> 04:39:58.949
yes and yes, they are on broad

04:39:59.451 --> 04:40:01.451
street and because of that, we

04:40:01.453 --> 04:40:03.521
will be joining them for kind of
an early. We would if this is

04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:06.390
approved, we would join them to

04:40:06.827 --> 04:40:08.827
tie our work together. We'd
actually be accelerating that

04:40:09.495 --> 04:40:12.364
section a little bit just to
make sure we don't MISS That

04:40:13.132 --> 04:40:15.300
window to join them. So they're
doing some utility work on broad

04:40:16.202 --> 04:40:18.202
that we would incorporate our

04:40:20.720 --> 04:40:22.341
bulb work into. That's great. I
like I mean, I'm really this is

04:40:23.777 --> 04:40:25.777
great to hear because learning

04:40:25.880 --> 04:40:28.847
from our recent experiences, you
know, we should be really making

04:40:29.415 --> 04:40:31.583
sure we are proactive into
reaching out to other agencies

04:40:33.319 --> 04:40:35.319
to make sure that if we can, um,

04:40:37.690 --> 04:40:40.460
if we can allow our schedule to
work with their so then it

04:40:43.864 --> 04:40:45.798
provides minimum disrupt option
to our neighborhood and

04:40:47.467 --> 04:40:49.467
communities will be better for

04:40:49.536 --> 04:40:51.536
us. So I'm glad that your team

04:40:53.640 --> 04:40:56.542
is doing that. So lastly, I have
one question I exactly where is

04:40:59.246 --> 04:41:01.246
this church located? And yeah,

04:41:02.983 --> 04:41:05.785
um, if I can pull up the
presentation again, the church

04:41:07.210 --> 04:41:09.210
is located on 19th avenue. Hold

04:41:11.558 --> 04:41:13.558
on a second. So it's located on

04:41:13.761 --> 04:41:15.761
19th avenue, just east of

04:41:16.397 --> 04:41:18.397
junipero serra. It's if you see

04:41:18.466 --> 04:41:20.466
where that sign is that says new

04:41:21.680 --> 04:41:23.680
stops with boarding islands and

04:41:23.700 --> 04:41:26.500
wheelchair accessible ramps that
sort of call out box. That's

04:41:26.730 --> 04:41:28.730
exactly the block where the

04:41:28.275 --> 04:41:31.112
church is located or the
facility is located at occupies

04:41:31.112 --> 04:41:33.112
that entire block, pretty much.

04:41:34.682 --> 04:41:37.517
Oh, that's the salvation army
block. Yes. Okay, great. Thank

04:41:41.355 --> 04:41:43.355
you. Thank you. Director hensley

04:41:45.293 --> 04:41:47.494
. Thank you to the team for this
update in and seeking our

04:41:50.799 --> 04:41:53.367
feedback. Um, during director
kina, as you know, more detailed

04:41:54.970 --> 04:41:56.970
questions and I would defer to

04:42:00.575 --> 04:42:03.377
her as she she has the deep
corridor knowledge and I am

04:42:04.545 --> 04:42:06.545
particularly excited about the

04:42:08.517 --> 04:42:10.517
accessing ability of the

04:42:10.652 --> 04:42:12.652
accessibility improvements of

04:42:14.589 --> 04:42:17.491
the boarding islands. Um, so to
that end, the one thing I will

04:42:18.426 --> 04:42:20.426
do is sort of give high level

04:42:21.162 --> 04:42:23.162
direction. I want my, my opinion

04:42:24.667 --> 04:42:26.667
of it anyway, for your 19th

04:42:30.472 --> 04:42:33.207
avenue proposal, um, I, I would
work with community of course.

04:42:34.176 --> 04:42:37.144
And thank you to the members of
the church who came out today.

04:42:41.684 --> 04:42:43.684
But I, I would. And I think

04:42:45.454 --> 04:42:47.454
staff is going this direction

04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:52.260
already, but I would not, not
not recommend doing option three

04:42:53.562 --> 04:42:55.562
and working with community to

04:42:56.832 --> 04:42:58.832
try to see if you can come to

04:42:58.902 --> 04:43:00.902
some sort of agreement between

04:43:03.500 --> 04:43:05.500
option one and two. I I concur

04:43:06.509 --> 04:43:08.509
with the caller that I mean,

04:43:08.678 --> 04:43:10.678
removal of the boarding island

04:43:11.246 --> 04:43:13.246
did not doing the key stop would

04:43:15.384 --> 04:43:17.486
be would be a step back on the
whole for this this project. So

04:43:20.190 --> 04:43:23.125
I would support moving forward
with working with community to

04:43:24.160 --> 04:43:26.160
hopefully come to an agreement

04:43:26.329 --> 04:43:28.329
between options one and two.

04:43:31.400 --> 04:43:33.301
Thank you chair. Thank. You.
Director hennessy. Director

04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:36.405
kahina. Did you want to speak
again? Yeah, I just had a

04:43:36.840 --> 04:43:38.840
clarifying question on the 19th

04:43:39.943 --> 04:43:42.770
avenue proposal. Is there a
reason why we're removing

04:43:42.579 --> 04:43:44.579
parking in front of the church

04:43:44.814 --> 04:43:46.814
to accommodate the bike lane? Is

04:43:47.684 --> 04:43:49.684
that. No, it's mostly to provide

04:43:49.886 --> 04:43:52.210
the boarding platform. Otherwise
as people would step off the

04:43:53.991 --> 04:43:55.991
train into a parking lane. And

04:43:56.426 --> 04:43:59.195
it's such a wide travel lane too
that it's possible for vehicles

04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:03.399
to drive between the train and
the park cars even though it's

04:44:03.600 --> 04:44:06.302
not a second travel lane. So if
there weren't if this wasn't a

04:44:06.503 --> 04:44:08.503
bike route, what we would be

04:44:08.973 --> 04:44:11.107
proposing here is a bulb like
connected to the sidewalk, the

04:44:11.342 --> 04:44:13.376
full length of the train car
probably. But because there's a

04:44:13.611 --> 04:44:16.546
bike lane here, it's an island.
So the bikes can pass through as

04:44:18.248 --> 04:44:20.683
well. And so this would be a
these are new stops that we're

04:44:21.840 --> 04:44:23.886
proposing here. And the old
stops, it looks like, were

04:44:26.324 --> 04:44:28.324
before randolph or I guess is it

04:44:28.960 --> 04:44:31.270
north? North of randolph. Is
that right? That's right. So

04:44:33.164 --> 04:44:35.865
there's currently a stop just
just south of jserra or just

04:44:38.200 --> 04:44:40.103
east of jserra. It's like right
before 19th avenue turns onto

04:44:41.138 --> 04:44:43.106
jserra. And that stop, you know,
there's a turn lane. There's

04:44:43.775 --> 04:44:46.477
really nowhere to put a safe
boarding island or boarding

04:44:47.378 --> 04:44:50.800
bulb. So that stop would go away
because there's really no way to

04:44:50.915 --> 04:44:53.517
upgrade it. And then there is
another stop down at 19th avenue

04:44:54.852 --> 04:44:56.852
where it intersects with

04:44:57.210 --> 04:44:59.556
randolph that stop would also be
consolidated and into this new

04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:04.161
stop at sargeant, which is in
front of the salvation army.

04:45:04.763 --> 04:45:07.640
And, you know, even if we were
to keep the stop at 19th and

04:45:07.866 --> 04:45:09.866
randolph it that would not serve

04:45:10.668 --> 04:45:12.669
people kind of farther to the
north. And we've heard specific

04:45:14.439 --> 04:45:17.207
feedback from folks who go to
the senior center which is which

04:45:17.975 --> 04:45:19.977
is closer to this new stop
location that it's really

04:45:20.412 --> 04:45:23.315
important to have a stop as
close as possible to that

04:45:23.315 --> 04:45:25.315
facility and especially an

04:45:28.653 --> 04:45:30.653
accessible stop. Okay. And so I

04:45:31.523 --> 04:45:33.523
asked this not to say you have

04:45:33.758 --> 04:45:36.727
it. I'm sure you have, but I
would really want staff to

04:45:37.696 --> 04:45:39.696
consider or the team to consider

04:45:41.300 --> 04:45:43.300
alternate placement of those

04:45:47.206 --> 04:45:49.307
stops because it seems like I
like I understand at least

04:45:50.208 --> 04:45:52.944
having like a loading zone there
for a lot of the seniors that

04:45:52.944 --> 04:45:54.980
would access those services or
just something there. Right.

04:45:55.214 --> 04:45:57.214
Because it seems like this

04:45:57.416 --> 04:45:59.416
institution is serving folks

04:46:00.860 --> 04:46:02.860
that have a wide range of

04:46:03.355 --> 04:46:05.355
mobility issues and that having

04:46:06.659 --> 04:46:08.659
some some placement there some

04:46:09.194 --> 04:46:11.964
way for folks to at least drop
off, you know, a parent or

04:46:14.367 --> 04:46:17.335
someone would would be critical
for them. So I just again, I

04:46:18.400 --> 04:46:19.938
guess going back to my earlier
direction, work with the

04:46:21.274 --> 04:46:24.109
community. But I think in the
many of options that you're

04:46:27.113 --> 04:46:28.613
considering that go, I guess it
would be alternative for

04:46:29.316 --> 04:46:31.316
alternative, a new alternative

04:46:33.286 --> 04:46:35.286
if you all could explore a

04:46:35.588 --> 04:46:37.588
different placement of the bus.

04:46:37.991 --> 04:46:40.826
Sorry, of the loading zones or
the loading area. Sorry um, to

04:46:42.895 --> 04:46:45.397
try to see if there's a way to
accommodate the needs of the

04:46:45.899 --> 04:46:47.899
folks here. Um, again, not

04:46:48.502 --> 04:46:50.502
saying you haven't done this

04:46:51.338 --> 04:46:53.338
already, but I think we should

04:46:53.540 --> 04:46:55.540
try to figure out a way to

04:46:55.709 --> 04:46:57.709
balance the needs there a little

04:46:58.111 --> 04:47:00.379
bit more. Well, and just to
clarify, any other location that

04:47:01.448 --> 04:47:04.250
would serve the senior center
and be anywhere near the current

04:47:05.850 --> 04:47:07.850
stop would have to block an

04:47:07.388 --> 04:47:09.956
intersection on. There's just no
other street frontage that is

04:47:10.958 --> 04:47:13.192
long enough to place a stop. So
I hear that direction. But if

04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:15.795
that is direction from the
board, we would need to know

04:47:16.563 --> 04:47:18.530
that that's also the direction
to consider blocking an

04:47:19.266 --> 04:47:21.266
intersection. Correct? And when

04:47:21.369 --> 04:47:23.670
I say work with the community, I
think it's the senior center

04:47:25.720 --> 04:47:27.720
included in the mix as well,

04:47:27.942 --> 04:47:29.942
because it does seem like we

04:47:30.244 --> 04:47:32.244
have some competing priorities

04:47:32.479 --> 04:47:34.479
within the community and that

04:47:35.480 --> 04:47:37.480
needs to get sorted out as well.

04:47:37.317 --> 04:47:39.317
So it's a tough position to be

04:47:39.721 --> 04:47:41.722
in as staff to try to bridge
those those competing priorities

04:47:44.250 --> 04:47:46.292
and try to find a solution. But
you all are very talented and I

04:47:47.610 --> 04:47:49.610
know you're up for the challenge

04:47:51.232 --> 04:47:53.232
. So I would encourage folks to

04:47:53.300 --> 04:47:55.300
the team to try to bridge these

04:47:55.469 --> 04:47:58.372
competing priorities and find a
mutual agreeable solution

04:48:12.253 --> 04:48:14.253
between them.

04:48:14.255 --> 04:48:17.158
So thank you for that. Um, we
have technically closed public

04:48:18.260 --> 04:48:19.827
comment, but I know it's been a
long day, so. Sure, go ahead.

04:48:21.162 --> 04:48:23.162
You've been here a long time. Go

04:48:23.765 --> 04:48:25.765
ahead. What's up? So I just want

04:48:27.702 --> 04:48:30.470
to make clear right, the current
proposal, I'm not sure. I just

04:48:31.173 --> 04:48:33.975
want to make clear. Okay, so
option 1 or 2 deputy city

04:48:35.777 --> 04:48:37.912
attorney is just not allowing.
That's right. Sorry. If you have

04:48:38.747 --> 04:48:40.747
questions for the members of the

04:48:40.815 --> 04:48:42.950
community, you MAY ask them. But
if the gentleman has already

04:48:44.452 --> 04:48:46.452
spoken tonight, he does not get

04:48:46.855 --> 04:48:48.855
another opportunity. Okay. Just

04:48:50.250 --> 04:48:52.727
one comment. If maybe it's
better to speak to staff, you

04:48:52.928 --> 04:48:55.230
could go into the hallway and
share it with staff or

04:48:55.998 --> 04:48:57.998
something. The staff could could

04:48:59.701 --> 04:49:01.701
hear from you directly. Yeah

04:49:03.338 --> 04:49:06.273
okay. Um. Okay. I just wanted to
share one piece of feedback you

04:49:06.642 --> 04:49:08.642
had asked us for a decision on

04:49:09.512 --> 04:49:11.581
these three potential options.
Whenever we're faced with these

04:49:12.414 --> 04:49:14.414
decisions, I just want to inform

04:49:15.451 --> 04:49:17.451
any decision making with values.

04:49:18.787 --> 04:49:20.755
So whichever to me is the safest
for pedestrians and transit

04:49:22.291 --> 04:49:24.426
riders, whichever is the most in
lined with our transit first

04:49:25.662 --> 04:49:27.662
policy and in support of our

04:49:27.964 --> 04:49:30.632
transit riders and whichever is
the most accessible. So those

04:49:31.567 --> 04:49:33.735
would be some of the values that
I would encourage falling back

04:49:35.104 --> 04:49:36.738
on. To me, splitting up the
wheelchair accessible stop from

04:49:37.406 --> 04:49:40.800
the regular stop seems very
bizarre. And I did want to

04:49:40.811 --> 04:49:42.978
understand what what does this
mean in practice? Does this mean

04:49:44.514 --> 04:49:46.949
that the train will stop and
then we'll stop again in very,

04:49:48.151 --> 04:49:50.151
very nearby for any wheelchair

04:49:50.987 --> 04:49:53.722
requiring passengers? Yes and
best practice is certainly to

04:49:55.124 --> 04:49:57.124
have them joined. You have to

04:49:57.593 --> 04:49:59.662
stop twice no matter what,
because you're always going to

04:50:00.597 --> 04:50:02.632
stop at even if it's a join
boarding island, you're stopping

04:50:03.000 --> 04:50:05.000
at the general loading area and

04:50:05.168 --> 04:50:07.838
then you have to the train has
to inch up to get to the

04:50:07.838 --> 04:50:09.972
boarding platform for wheelchair
users. But having them all in

04:50:10.941 --> 04:50:12.908
one place is the most legible.
It feels safest because it's

04:50:13.420 --> 04:50:15.770
been pointed out people don't
feel like they're kind of

04:50:15.646 --> 04:50:18.614
isolated in their own location.
But it is something we
occasionally do. If splitting

04:50:19.650 --> 04:50:22.585
stops for technical or other
reasons. Okay. Thank you. That's

04:50:22.686 --> 04:50:24.686
that's the feedback I wanted to

04:50:25.220 --> 04:50:27.220
share. Any other colleagues have

04:50:28.992 --> 04:50:30.992
comments on this item? Okay it's

04:50:31.161 --> 04:50:33.662
not a voting item, it's just
informational. So we'll go ahead

04:50:34.465 --> 04:50:36.465
and adjourn the meeting and the

04:50:36.601 --> 04:50:39.269
next meeting is NOVEMBER 28th
for the vision zero subcommittee

04:50:40.171 --> 04:50:42.472
and DECEMBER fifth for this last
board meeting of the year. Thank

04:51:01.292 --> 04:51:03.292
you all. Thank you.
