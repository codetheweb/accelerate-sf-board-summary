WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


00:06:27.438 --> 00:06:29.438
love the way you interact with

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.339
our communities representing our
small businesses, and also the

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:36.277
passion and the personal
approach that you gave to

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:42.490
everyone is just refreshing for
city government. As a

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.210
commissioner and board. So I
know that you're not going to go

00:06:48.957 --> 00:06:51.926
away. It this is free you up to
do a lot more and more

00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:54.429
meaningful things that you
wanted to pursue in your career

00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.764
and your personal life. So I

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100
wanted to say I MISS You a lot

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:02.936
sitting between me and director

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:05.572
hemminger passing note to each

00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:09.242
other. But but I really wish you

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.814
the best of the best for the
future. Whatever you want to be.

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:22.222
And thank you for your service.

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:25.292
So as the most junior one here,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.620
I just want to thank you for the

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.564
example that you set and the

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.102
voice that you've been for the
business owners, for the

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.605
community members. I think that
it is really, really, really

00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:43.645
important. To you, to the
community, the voice that you've

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:47.816
given and I you know, one of the
things about thought leadership

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:50.918
is sometimes, you know,

00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:54.156
sometimes it's hard. It's
sometimes you're not liked, you

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:58.930
know, and sometimes times in
order to lead, you have to be

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.961
willing to step out there and

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:03.165
not necessarily be liked, but be
that leader. And I feel like,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.770
you have found a way to find the
right intersection between

00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:10.671
having folks love you very much

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.575
and also so leading us in the

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.479
right direction. And so I really
do want to offer my support to

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:21.170
the endeavors that you have
coming up. And I appreciate the

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.120
example that you set in the

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:26.388
doors that you've opened for us
as commissioners and for this

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.191
agency, really. So best wishes

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.620
and I'll hand it back over to my

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.980
to the chair. Thank you,

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:38.567
colleagues. Director hensley I'm

00:08:38.702 --> 00:08:40.702
just creating some space in case

00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:45.941
you want to chime in. I guess.
That be beyond because to bid

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:52.114
our esteemed former colleague
farewell here, you know

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:56.619
directory and I were co

00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:00.656
nominated together. We we've

00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:02.991
literally been in these trenches

00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:07.290
together and you will be leaving
a hole on this board. You

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.771
represent a very unique
community and you brought a

00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:19.642
voice to really be able to try

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:24.140
to unify all different
communities and all different

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:27.416
perspectives and that is the

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.320
spirit of unification that we

00:09:31.456 --> 00:09:33.456
need into the government. Um, in

00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:39.462
general. So I, I, I know that

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:44.167
you're not going far, far as our
colleagues have said, and I know

00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:51.675
that this will free you up to
impact the city and, and the

00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.245
world and other ways and we, I

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:58.481
think we all look forward to

00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:02.284
hearing what those ways will be.

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:04.388
And I know that you will also

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.557
continue to hold this board

00:10:08.927 --> 00:10:10.927
accountable for really the

00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:15.866
values that you stand for and
continue to apply that managed

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:20.703
way. And what ever other area of

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.144
the of the corners of the world

00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:27.311
that you choose to have impact

00:10:28.246 --> 00:10:30.448
in. So I know that we'll all be
in touch, keep you in touch as

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.950
friends. And so and thank you

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.850
for your service. Thank you.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.990
Director kowtow. The floor is

00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:44.429
yours. Do I have two minutes?
Well, thank you very much,

00:10:44.763 --> 00:10:46.763
colleagues. I guess former

00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.436
colleagues. I started on the
small business commission and I

00:10:52.271 --> 00:10:54.572
think I started about 6 or 9
months before the pandemic. And

00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:56.707
then in the middle of the

00:10:57.477 --> 00:10:59.477
pandemic was brought to you all.

00:10:59.479 --> 00:11:01.646
And like I said, in the last
meeting, it has been a huge

00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:05.416
honor to especially sit next to

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:10.455
steve heminger for so long and
learned so much from you. You've

00:11:15.128 --> 00:11:17.128
been such a great mentor to me.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.990
Yeah, I guess the city really

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.350
this city really took me in and

00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:33.178
gave me a home. And just to be a

00:11:34.314 --> 00:11:37.116
young person and a and a
business owner and a openly gay

00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:41.319
person to sit where you all sit.

00:11:44.257 --> 00:11:46.257
Oh, my GOD. Sorry yeah, it's a

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:50.562
huge honor because this, this

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.340
this city is all I have. So so

00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:59.137
we do great work here. And I

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.607
think as I look back on the
years that I've spent on this

00:12:02.909 --> 00:12:04.909
board, the memories that I will

00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:06.946
cherish the most are actually

00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:12.518
the sometimes ungodly hour that

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.870
I had been called to visit and

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.425
tour some of our facilities to
hand out what seems like the

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.863
only breakfast burrito that we
give to employees at every

00:12:23.665 --> 00:12:25.665
single company event. But in

00:12:26.868 --> 00:12:29.603
seriousness, to meet the people
who, some of whom have spent

00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:33.139
over 40 years, which is older
than I am, you know, making our

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:36.141
agency work, waking up every

00:12:38.145 --> 00:12:40.145
morning in an unglamorous way to

00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:42.516
do the work of moving this city
forward. We have amazing people

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.650
that work for us, really,

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:46.719
honestly, some of the greatest

00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:48.721
public employees I've ever met.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.925
And so it was an honor to
represent them up there. It was

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.561
an honor to try to do the job

00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:58.197
well. And yes, I think to bring

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:00.633
a sense of unity to this work.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.804
It made me sad. And sometimes
sitting where you're sitting,

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:09.510
seeing our city seem so divided
and to see neighbors yelling at

00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:12.679
neighbors, to see taxi drivers
yelling at each other and

00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:16.717
seemingly at everyone else, and

00:13:16.718 --> 00:13:19.654
to see us try to do some big,
bold, exciting things and to and

00:13:20.455 --> 00:13:22.590
to find the communities
struggling to accept it. And I

00:13:23.658 --> 00:13:26.260
guess if I could leave you with
anything, it would just be that

00:13:27.462 --> 00:13:29.229
a reminder that there are much
bigger problems out there than

00:13:30.298 --> 00:13:32.298
whether or not there are

00:13:32.868 --> 00:13:35.690
barricades in the middle of the
street or slightly off center,

00:13:37.306 --> 00:13:39.730
and that we need to see the
bigger picture with some of our

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.420
projects and that my hope is

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.410
that the public, when they come

00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.479
to speak to you, that they do so

00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:48.716
with a little bit more respect.
It was really hard sitting up

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.510
there and getting screamed at

00:13:51.187 --> 00:13:53.187
and yelled at and to have verbal

00:13:53.489 --> 00:13:55.724
tomatoes thrown at me and not be
able to either respond back or

00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:00.529
just say, you know, I'm a person
to you. And I think for the

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:02.529
public behind me and those

00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:04.799
listening, just remember that
the folks that you're providing

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.340
your comment to, they also have

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.370
feelings and they're just trying

00:14:10.773 --> 00:14:12.607
to do their their job for the
employees of our agency, in

00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:17.311
particular, the folks who are in

00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:20.582
our offices, I would love our I
would love to see our agency be

00:14:21.183 --> 00:14:23.183
the agency of. Yes. And the

00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:25.285
agency of let's try it. Is that

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:28.389
am I being I'm being walked off

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.428
because what's clear to me is in
this city, in our government, we

00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:36.980
do not create an incentive
structure for our city employees

00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:41.360
to take risks. There are too
many ways in which that risk

00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:43.805
taking can bite them in the butt

00:14:43.907 --> 00:14:46.420
. And I think we really need to
start doing that. We really need

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.110
to start incentivize using our
employees, our bureaucrats, our

00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:52.213
leadership to be willing to try

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:54.917
things and see if they work, as
opposed to being afraid of

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:57.152
angering, whether it's the
public or the communities,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.156
because otherwise we're not
going to continue to be the

00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:02.924
innovative city that we all want

00:15:03.393 --> 00:15:05.393
us to be. And finally, to you

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.290
all, I know what it's like to

00:15:08.565 --> 00:15:10.800
sit there. I know how hard it is
to make these decisions. And I

00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:14.169
know how sometimes it can feel
like you are in fact, at a

00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:17.739
potted plant and my challenge to

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.110
you is to remember our customers
. Our customers are the people

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.281
who take muni, of course, and we
need to keep our system clean

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.170
and safe. And our customers are
the people who are getting

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.387
parking tickets and are getting
their car towed in the middle of

00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:34.523
the night because they parked in
the wrong place. They deserve

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:37.259
your attention too. And so to

00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:39.329
constantly be thinking about how
we treat our customers with love

00:15:41.299 --> 00:15:43.299
and respect and to try to do

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:45.501
what's best for them and

00:15:47.938 --> 00:15:50.840
finally, you do. We didn't
always agree on everything, but

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.710
we always disagreed respectfully

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.380
. And I feel very honored to
have been able to be in the

00:15:56.981 --> 00:15:58.981
trenches with you, to serve on

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:01.283
this agency. C during a once in

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:03.486
a century crisis, and to see you
really rise to the occasion. It

00:16:05.323 --> 00:16:08.158
wasn't easy. And no matter what
you do from here on out and how

00:16:08.794 --> 00:16:10.794
the agency continues to grow and

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:14.265
progress, I hope you know that
you did something really special

00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:17.134
by pulling us out of such a dark
time and doing it with such

00:16:17.802 --> 00:16:19.802
honor and such diligence and

00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:23.600
such clear commitment to this
city. So congratulations on

00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:26.760
doing that. And thank you,
everyone, very much. I

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.785
appreciate this. And I guess
I'll continue to try to do my

00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:36.553
work in the manny's way. Thank

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.831

they're listening to the meeting

00:19:00.634 --> 00:19:02.634
on the computer. Next speaker.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.370
Hi, sorry, I'm rocking. My day

00:19:07.108 --> 00:19:09.843

If I were very good at it.

00:19:12.413 --> 00:19:14.413
Speaker you've been unmuted. Oh,

much having you up there. You

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.860
did wonders for the board and
for speaking what's so many of

00:19:27.629 --> 00:19:29.629
us were thinking, especially on

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:32.865
december 6th, 2022, when we will

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.935
be called for everyone to lay
down their arms and for the

00:19:36.304 --> 00:19:38.572
agency to do what's right and
connect our city for people

00:19:41.944 --> 00:19:43.944
outside of cars. And I thank you

00:19:45.613 --> 00:19:47.848
and I thank all of the joy, the
joy that you would bring to the

00:19:48.216 --> 00:19:50.216
meeting and your patience and

00:19:51.186 --> 00:19:53.186
your humor. You are one of a

00:19:54.389 --> 00:19:56.490
kind and I'm very sorry that
you're leaving too soon. But I

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.194
know that you are doing great
things in this world and will

00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:03.196
continue to do so, especially

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.320
for our city. So thank you.

00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:10.371
Thanks, manny jen psaki by.
Thank you. Let's return back to

00:20:18.213 --> 00:20:20.213
the first speaker. Speaker

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:31.157
you've been unmuted.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.294
Sure you can. Sounds like they
don't know they've been unmuted

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.164
and that's the last caller. The
last caller. Okay we will then

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:39.934
go ahead and close public
comment and please call the next

00:20:40.703 --> 00:20:42.703
item places you an item number

00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:47.974
seven, the director's report.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.210
Good afternoon. Directors got a

00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:52.814
lot of items covered today. But

00:20:52.815 --> 00:20:54.449
first and foremost, I want to
bring up transit director julie

00:20:57.453 --> 00:20:59.321
kirschbaum and our cfo and just
transit director julie

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.560
kirschbaum, who will be offering

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:05.258
a special recognition. I happen

00:21:05.895 --> 00:21:08.164
to know that barry is biking
here, so she tries to blame

00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:14.869
muni. Don't take it. I'm excited

00:21:16.606 --> 00:21:18.807
to be here to present to people
that I think really embody the

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.545
agency of yes, that manny was
just talking about was just

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.950
giving you a hard time. I'm not

00:21:30.587 --> 00:21:32.587
one of the people of. Yes do you

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.990
want to start? Oh, sure. Good

00:21:36.693 --> 00:21:39.294
afternoon, board members. My
name is barry. I'm the cfo of

00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:43.832
the mta and as julie said, we're

00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:46.869
very excited to be here to
present a recognition award to

00:21:48.605 --> 00:21:51.107
diana hammons, who is the senior
manager of revenue collections

00:21:51.541 --> 00:21:53.541
and sales. Her team is

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.910
responsible for gathering up all

00:21:56.713 --> 00:21:58.447
of the money and all of the fare
media that make both parking and

00:22:00.618 --> 00:22:02.618
transit run, as well as leslie

00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:07.490
bernfield, who plans special
events for transit. And for me,
this is a particularly special

00:22:08.993 --> 00:22:10.993
moment because diana hired me in

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.900
2006 to my first job at the mta.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.805
Leslie has done, I think, a
masterful job of improving both

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.308
our internal and our external
communication lines around

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.310
special events. And especially

00:22:28.612 --> 00:22:31.548
as the city recovers, as there's
been such an attention on to

00:22:32.683 --> 00:22:34.683
special events. But I'm

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:37.621
particularly excited about the
way that she partnered and

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.690
collaborated with diana,

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.792
particularly around outside

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.529
lands outside lands is a 75,000

00:22:46.597 --> 00:22:48.597
person event. It's essentially

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.900
like having for chase center

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.390
events. All all over three days.
And we for a long time have

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.577
really wanted to have the same
model that we have for chase

00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:03.112
where your ticket to the event

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.382
is your ticket to muni and in

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.451
this case, it will now be your

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.421
bracelet to outside lands. Is

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.891
your ticket to muni and leslie

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.928
and diana worked really closely
with the outside events team to

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:21.865
understand the experience that
the event wanted to deliver to

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.868
review the lessons learned from

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:27.604
previous years, to really figure

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.675
out where we could commit, but
also making sure that we didn't

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:36.247
overcommit it. And as a result
that we were able to get

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.616
agreement on this really

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.888
exciting event and partnership.
Also special thanks to the

00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:47.291
outside land producer. Another

00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:49.326
planet entertainment for helping

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:51.528
us reach this milestone on and

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:54.265
just you know in the same way
that brie and I are constant

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:57.235
collaborating as we move this
forward, we also wanted to

00:23:58.237 --> 00:24:00.237
celebrate where we're seeing our

00:24:02.976 --> 00:24:04.976
team collaborate is that it? So

00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:09.113
and that is all we have. Well,

00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:11.949
we got to give them the because

00:24:22.595 --> 00:24:24.595
come on up. Come on up. Just.

00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:28.200
Hello everybody. Nice to be
here. Thank you so much to you

00:24:29.736 --> 00:24:32.504
and to julie and my manager,
sean, for this recognition. And

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.540
it's truly a pleasure to be part
of throwing these events that

00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:38.209
make san francisco what it is.

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:40.446
And to introduce transit as part
of the integral experience of

00:24:42.249 --> 00:24:44.249
coming to, to and from all of

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:46.385
those events. I just also want
to recognize my colleagues from

00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:49.721
dispatching demetrius jackson,

00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:52.424
the operators who are out there
with incredible enthusiasm under

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.660
the leadership of anthony over

00:24:57.364 --> 00:24:59.533
here from t52 and oh, and also
edward dennis and our

00:24:59.533 --> 00:25:02.134
incredible, incredible field
team that supports the operators

00:25:03.603 --> 00:25:05.603
on the field during this event.

00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:12.377
So thank you. Good afternoon.

00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:14.446
Board of directors. Thank you

00:25:14.515 --> 00:25:16.515
for this recognition. Thank you.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.253
Brie and julie for this. I think
julie's taking a little pleasure

00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:23.523
in this because she knows how
uncomfortable I am in this

00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:27.692
moment. But I do want to say I'm

00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:30.564
so grateful for the opportunity
that I've been given in this

00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:34.367
agency to work on such special
projects that are so important

00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:40.600
to the city. But also the space
that is created for me to be

00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:43.709
able to do that is really the

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:46.814
amazing team that I have that I
work with, including fred

00:25:46.915 --> 00:25:48.915
shelton, our revenue operations

00:25:49.951 --> 00:25:52.519
manager, our juan pena, the
acting manager of our station

00:25:53.855 --> 00:25:56.590
and permit section, and emmett
nelson, who's our program

00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:00.227
development manager and manages
all of our discount programs. So

00:26:01.529 --> 00:26:03.596
so I'm very grateful for this.
Thank you all. Thank you.

00:26:22.384 --> 00:26:24.384
Director tomlin. The board.

00:26:32.594 --> 00:26:35.529
Thank you, sir, for your
service. And congratulations on

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.631
your recognition. And thank you
also to leadership for

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.968
continuing to make spaces to
specifically acknowledge a

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.172
contribution of staff. I think
it's important to educate the
board and the public about the

00:26:44.306 --> 00:26:46.306
meaningful contributions of the

00:26:46.408 --> 00:26:48.408
members of this community. Back

00:26:48.577 --> 00:26:51.120
to you. Director tomlin. Thank
you. And I do just want to

00:26:52.717 --> 00:26:55.316
acknowledge that. So much of the
real work that happens in this

00:26:56.452 --> 00:26:59.354
agency goes unreported. And
certainly the people who are
doing that real work, people

00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:03.157
like leslie and diana, exemplify
the hard working, dedicated

00:27:04.693 --> 00:27:06.693
staff of this agency that make

00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:08.895
me so proud to be working for

00:27:09.498 --> 00:27:12.433
them. So thank you, team. All
right. Lots to cover. I hope all

00:27:14.537 --> 00:27:16.438
of you know that there is this
little event next week called

00:27:18.674 --> 00:27:20.674
apec. We're starting to see some

00:27:21.444 --> 00:27:24.245
of the preparatory impacts for
most city agencies. It has been

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.949
all hands on deck the last
couple of weeks. And I really

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.150
want to thank tony henderson,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.870
who is our command command in

00:27:33.423 --> 00:27:35.791
chief for organizing everyone at
the agency. And julie

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.193
kirschbaum, who's been leading
the executive level and the

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.290
hundreds and hundreds of people

00:27:42.165 --> 00:27:44.165
who are working to try to make

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.901
this event a success. This is a
pretty big deal for san

00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:49.606
francisco. This is the biggest
international event that the

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.575
city has hosted since the united
nations charter was signed in

00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:57.212
san francisco in 1945. PRESIDENT
Biden will be here along with

00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:02.483
chinese PRESIDENT Xi jinping and

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:04.719
world leaders from around the

00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:07.221
pacific rim. The main impacts of

00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:09.725
the event are going to be felt
starting monday, NOVEMBER 13th

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.460
through sunday, NOVEMBER 19th,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.980
and will be mainly concentrated
in the areas surrounding the

00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:19.667
moscone center and at the top of

00:28:19.803 --> 00:28:22.504
nob hill. But there are events
all over san francisco, and so

00:28:23.207 --> 00:28:25.207
there will be traffic impacts

00:28:25.242 --> 00:28:27.242
associated with motorcades and

00:28:27.411 --> 00:28:29.411
many of the events are in flux.

00:28:31.615 --> 00:28:34.550
So our team is responding to
constant changes. If world

00:28:35.686 --> 00:28:37.853
leaders suddenly want to have a
new get together at the last

00:28:38.856 --> 00:28:40.856
minute, that is something that

00:28:40.892 --> 00:28:43.760
our team will figure out how to
accommodate. But it is also

00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:45.761
resulted in some pretty

00:28:45.796 --> 00:28:47.796
significant transit impacts. And

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.934
I really want to thank both the
transit team, but especially the

00:28:51.635 --> 00:28:54.404
united states. Secret service
for taking the needs of san

00:28:55.539 --> 00:28:58.374
francisco neighborhood residents
and small business is seriously

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:01.244
while also maintaining the

00:29:01.946 --> 00:29:04.848
security for all of these world
leaders. So our team has been

00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:09.385
able to deal with the fact that
moscone yerba buena station on

00:29:10.254 --> 00:29:12.254
the central subway will need to

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.790
be closed. So we will be

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.795
rerouting the t third trains via
the embarcadero into the market

00:29:18.797 --> 00:29:21.498
street subway and merging it
with the k trains, just like we

00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:24.267
did before the central subway
opened. So that's a familiar

00:29:24.268 --> 00:29:26.268
pattern. We're also really

00:29:26.271 --> 00:29:28.271
grateful that we'll be able to

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.740
run a very frequent shuttle

00:29:31.108 --> 00:29:33.760
train from powell street station
and union square station,

00:29:33.812 --> 00:29:35.812
straight to chinatown and back

00:29:36.748 --> 00:29:38.748
about every five minutes, making

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.510
sure that chinatown stays very
connected to all of the events

00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:45.823
happening around apec. There'll
be a number of bus reroutes, all

00:29:46.758 --> 00:29:48.758
of those transportation details

00:29:49.394 --> 00:29:51.394
can be found on our website at

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.980
sfmta dot com slash api c that's

00:29:57.469 --> 00:29:59.469
sfmta.Com/ apec. We are

00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:01.671
updating that website at more

00:30:02.607 --> 00:30:04.642
than daily. Given the pace of
changes that we are receiving

00:30:05.644 --> 00:30:07.644
from the secret service. And on

00:30:08.914 --> 00:30:10.914
that website you can also sign

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.385
up for text or email updates to
better understand how to be able

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.210
to get around san francisco,
whether it is by driving or

00:30:17.956 --> 00:30:19.956
paratransit or walking or biking

00:30:21.393 --> 00:30:24.295
or muni. We'll also have
information available in over

00:30:26.265 --> 00:30:28.265
100 languages via 301 and have

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.370
recruited broadly for volunteers
who will be serving as

00:30:33.472 --> 00:30:35.640
ambassadors at all key places
throughout the city, including

00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:38.409
throughout the transit system to
not only help san franciscans

00:30:39.144 --> 00:30:41.144
get around, but to also help

00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:43.981
foreign visitors get around in

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.500
an over a dozen languages. So we

00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:51.222
are are we are. We are. We are

00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:55.600
optimistically ready and we know
now that all of our field teams

00:30:56.162 --> 00:30:58.162
will be able to adapt to

00:30:58.431 --> 00:31:00.431
changing circumstances. So this

00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:03.636
is a really fantastic time to be
in san francisco given the

00:31:04.771 --> 00:31:07.720
number of activities that will
be going on. This is not the

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.340
best time to be driving in san

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:11.376
francisco, so please do take

00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:13.511
caltrain or bart or the ferries

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.470
or muni in order to get around

00:31:16.616 --> 00:31:18.616
the next topic. I'm sure you've

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:21.521
also seen in the news is the
california department of motor

00:31:22.322 --> 00:31:24.322
vehicles suspended cruise

00:31:24.725 --> 00:31:27.159
permits to operate autonomous
vehicles without safety drivers

00:31:27.928 --> 00:31:29.928
in san francisco and the

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.731
california public utilities
commission followed up shortly

00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:38.971
after that ruling in order. To

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.600
no longer permit cruise to

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.750
operate commercial service with

00:31:44.645 --> 00:31:46.645
a safety driver. We do not yet

00:31:47.247 --> 00:31:49.247
know what conditions these dmv

00:31:49.716 --> 00:31:51.584
or cpuc will place on cruise and
what it will take for their

00:31:54.689 --> 00:31:56.689
permits to be reinstated. But we

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.910
are tracking closely. We also

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.127
continue to believe that
autonomous vehicles have the

00:32:01.562 --> 00:32:03.562
potential to produce significant

00:32:03.597 --> 00:32:06.199
benefits for the transportation
system, particularly around

00:32:07.434 --> 00:32:10.269
safety. But this confirms our
belief that autonomous vehicles

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:13.639
need to meet very, very specific

00:32:14.508 --> 00:32:16.508
safety thresholds in order to be

00:32:17.545 --> 00:32:19.145
granted the ability to expand
incrementally by demonstrating

00:32:20.514 --> 00:32:22.514
that they can operate safely

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.550
under all conditions before
being granted limitless

00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:29.521
expansion rights on on. Next up,

00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:32.259
I want to talk about state
funding, distribution of on

00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:35.261
OCTOBER 25th, the metropolitan

00:32:35.363 --> 00:32:37.898
transportation commission staff
presented their recommendations

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.670
for allocating. The $1.1 billion

00:32:42.436 --> 00:32:45.238
that was allocated by the state
government for additional

00:32:46.141 --> 00:32:48.141
transit relief. We are grateful

00:32:48.243 --> 00:32:51.178
that the mtc staff
recommendation is for the sfmta

00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:55.416
to receive more money than we
were expecting. Following upon

00:32:56.184 --> 00:32:58.184
the state's guidance in order to

00:33:00.622 --> 00:33:03.290
prioritize need and ridership in
the distribution of that

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:06.259
funding. As you know, the sfmta

00:33:07.563 --> 00:33:09.563
carries about. 47% of all

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.650
transit riders in the nine

00:33:14.302 --> 00:33:16.302
county bay area. The this money

00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:18.304
is very, very welcome. It,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.440
however, does not completely
close our fiscal cliff

00:33:24.446 --> 00:33:26.446
situation, but rather postpones

00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:30.117
the need to cut muni service

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:33.154
into 2026. While we continue to
work on identifying additional

00:33:34.957 --> 00:33:36.957
revenue sources to close the gap

00:33:37.727 --> 00:33:39.727
and ideally to get on the ballot

00:33:41.297 --> 00:33:43.966
in NOVEMBER of 2026, there is a
whole lot more that we are

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:46.734
collaborating with our other

00:33:47.336 --> 00:33:49.336
transit agencies, mtc and the

00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:51.671
state legislature on as well. In

00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:54.741
order to bring all the region's

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.779
transit operators into
integrated service and to make

00:33:58.681 --> 00:34:00.681
sure that we're able to find a

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.820
path out of our fiscal situation
. The next topic is also related

00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:08.889
to mtc, also on OCTOBER 24th,

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.794
mtc awarded an additional $16
million for bay wheels bike

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.980
share for e-bike expansion. As

00:34:17.334 --> 00:34:19.334
you well know, e-bikes are a

00:34:19.502 --> 00:34:21.502
miraculous tool for san

00:34:21.638 --> 00:34:23.638
francisco, effectively making

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.840
our very hilly city flat. For

00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:29.176
people who ride bikes. About 80%

00:34:29.245 --> 00:34:31.245
of the region wide bay wheels

00:34:32.616 --> 00:34:35.551
program trips are trips in san
francisco. And with this

00:34:37.788 --> 00:34:39.788
investment at bay wheels prices

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.570
will be able to go down both the
annual and monthly membership

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:46.461
fees will be reduced and the per

00:34:46.563 --> 00:34:48.563
minute fees will also be reduced

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:51.534
while we expand the e-bike
e-bike fleet throughout san

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.642
francisco. Next up, we are very
glad to announce that last week

00:35:00.677 --> 00:35:03.412
we hosted a pretty interesting
and significant international

00:35:06.117 --> 00:35:08.117
conference at the uitp, which is

00:35:08.252 --> 00:35:10.252
the international association of

00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:13.223
public transit had its 39th

00:35:15.192 --> 00:35:17.192
annual trolley bus meeting here

00:35:17.227 --> 00:35:19.227
in san francisco. More than 45

00:35:19.429 --> 00:35:21.898
visitors from around the globe.
Agencies that operate electric

00:35:22.968 --> 00:35:24.968
trolley busses from several

00:35:25.203 --> 00:35:27.270
different continents came here
to share their experiences and

00:35:28.606 --> 00:35:30.606
also to learn from us. I'm

00:35:31.442 --> 00:35:34.100
particularly proud to point out
at the sfmta is bob and carter

00:35:35.212 --> 00:35:37.818
who is here. Bob and has been
leading our electric bus

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:42.190
program. And more important, he
has been coordinating with the

00:35:42.921 --> 00:35:45.550
other four remaining electric
trolley bus operator in north

00:35:47.391 --> 00:35:49.391
america in order to ensure a

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.529
strong manufacturing market as
well as shared learning among

00:35:53.864 --> 00:35:56.766
our agencies in many ways, for
cities like san francisco,

00:35:57.936 --> 00:35:59.936
seattle and vancouver that have

00:36:00.305 --> 00:36:02.305
really clean, low cost

00:36:02.841 --> 00:36:04.841
hydropower, electricity and

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.811
steep hills, the trolley bus is
the perfect vehicle. Our san

00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:11.448
francisco trolley busses pull
power directly from hetch hetchy

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.585
into power fall hill climbing
engines that don't require that

00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:19.756
we carry two tons of batteries

00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:22.660
up and down our hills. And so
we're glad for the opportunity

00:36:23.562 --> 00:36:25.562
in order to continue to invest

00:36:27.632 --> 00:36:30.401
in our trolley bus system. So
this north american or this

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.770
global conference, we are able

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:36.341
to show off all of our
facilities to people around the

00:36:37.776 --> 00:36:40.511
world. We are also proud to
announce that our own chief

00:36:41.213 --> 00:36:43.213
maintenance officer, charles

00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:45.483
drain, was elected chair of the
international trolley bus

00:36:47.452 --> 00:36:49.452
committee and it gave us

00:36:51.157 --> 00:36:53.258
interesting practice hosting a
small but complex event for

00:36:54.827 --> 00:36:56.827
which I really want to thank my

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.430
chief of staff, victoria wise.

00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:01.465
Next up, I want to also

00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:05.435
celebrate that on OCTOBER 23rd

00:37:05.737 --> 00:37:08.440
and 26, our office of racial
equity and belonging hosted a

00:37:09.142 --> 00:37:11.142
community connections racial

00:37:11.377 --> 00:37:13.377
equity event at the southeast

00:37:13.579 --> 00:37:16.214
community center in the bayview.
This was done in collaboration

00:37:17.216 --> 00:37:19.216
with several other city

00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:21.385
departments welcoming young

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.555
residents and any members of the
public to understand and how to

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.727
build skills, tools, how to
network, how to increase access

00:37:29.563 --> 00:37:31.563
to city jobs and services,

00:37:32.966 --> 00:37:34.966
including how youth can engage

00:37:35.535 --> 00:37:37.535
with the city. We had more than

00:37:39.238 --> 00:37:41.940
90 people in attendance for a
whole variety of panel topic

00:37:44.611 --> 00:37:46.879
events and find me. I want to
show a fantastic little video

00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:51.216
that the team put together in

00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:55.153
honor of the bus rodeo that was
held on OCTOBER 28th at the cow

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.991
palace. This is a annual event
that was suspended during covid,

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.610
and we're so glad is back. We

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.630
had our transit operators

00:38:05.132 --> 00:38:07.132
navigate a very, very

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:09.969
challenging and complex course
out in the parking lot and you

00:38:11.204 --> 00:38:13.204
can play the video. Oh, but it's

00:38:16.576 --> 00:38:18.576
just music. All right. All right

00:38:18.913 --> 00:38:21.748
. Our transit operators
navigated a very complex course.

00:38:22.683 --> 00:38:24.683
Our maintenance officers

00:38:24.785 --> 00:38:27.420
competed in a whole variety of
technical events where they had

00:38:28.555 --> 00:38:30.555
to solve problems with engines

00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:33.693
in our parking control officers
competed in their three wheeled

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.763
gopher vehicles, navigating
tight timed courses while having

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.732
their colleagues yell at them.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.340
And very importantly, director.

00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.271
So got behind the wheel of a bus

00:38:47.174 --> 00:38:50.430
and the orange cones who are
sacrificed for her experience,

00:38:51.511 --> 00:38:53.511
I'm sure will will be forever

00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:56.450
mourned. We're very proud to
announce as well that the first

00:38:57.518 --> 00:38:59.518
place winner of the operator

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.956
event, mohamed ahmed and the
maintainers event, austin, you

00:39:03.991 --> 00:39:05.991
are. There she is. We'll be

00:39:06.193 --> 00:39:09.950
representing the sfmta at the
international rodeo in APRIL

00:39:10.132 --> 00:39:12.132
2024. In portland, oregon.

00:39:13.135 --> 00:39:15.135
Congratulations as well to our

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.500
second place managers. Winner
director lydia. Lydia so, lydia,

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:23.577
did you want to add anything?
Well, thank you very much. I

00:39:26.514 --> 00:39:28.514
love that video to be precise.

00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:31.520
I, I think I spare the orange
cone, but the barrels were

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.870
sacrificed, you know, really

00:39:35.757 --> 00:39:37.757
miserable alley. But I was

00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:39.926
really. I wanted to say, I. I

00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:42.328
have tremendous respect and also

00:39:42.664 --> 00:39:44.664
the patience agents that my

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.669
teacher, katrina brown, taught
me. And also everybody around

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.905
those cones and barrels were
really carefully making sure

00:39:51.873 --> 00:39:53.873
that they might need to adjust

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.212
it. As I moved along. And it was
great. I love that experience

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.553
because it does enlighten me a
deeper hands on understand

00:40:05.354 --> 00:40:07.522
taking on these challenges that
our operators and our mechanics

00:40:09.692 --> 00:40:11.692
face every day, pulling up and

00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:16.229
parallel park in every stop that

00:40:16.865 --> 00:40:18.865
you're within that 12in to the

00:40:20.403 --> 00:40:23.710
curb is not easy, man. I got to
tell you, I think I was two feet

00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:27.175
away, so it was it was a really
good experience. And thank you

00:40:28.711 --> 00:40:31.414
for everyone's patience with me
that day. I think I took I don't

00:40:31.414 --> 00:40:33.982
know what I did. I don't know
how I did. But I really

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.190
appreciate that. And I think
that I have the honor to meet

00:40:39.456 --> 00:40:41.456
the only asian american female

00:40:42.192 --> 00:40:44.192
mechanics who actually win the

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.360
award. And you see her on the

00:40:46.863 --> 00:40:48.863
slide. It was just melted in my

00:40:49.265 --> 00:40:51.533
heart to see, you know, women.
We can do it. It's really hard

00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:54.335
core doing the mechanics work

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.972
and I also met one of the
longest standing operators,

00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:03.211
staff and her his number is like

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.981
three digits. So I think he
started working for muni before

00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:09.717
I was born. So and this is

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.920
really echoing what our you want

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:16.892
to call him director yukito. He

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.280
said that we have so many muni

00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:22.865
operators and our staff actually
being in our agency for over

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
many, many decades and they are

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.870
they are the machine and they

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.840
are the reason why we keep san

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.844
francisco going. So I have a lot
deeper understanding in all

00:41:35.946 --> 00:41:38.800
these cases as susan in the
future might be bringing up to

00:41:38.915 --> 00:41:41.150
me. And I have a deeper
understanding of what they are

00:41:42.886 --> 00:41:44.886
about. Okay, thank you. I take

00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:47.523
up a lot of air time. Um, I like
to also take this opportunity to

00:41:48.593 --> 00:41:50.593
thank you, our director, jeff

00:41:52.697 --> 00:41:54.697
tomlin, and also our staff who

00:41:58.269 --> 00:42:00.269
had been basically really. They

00:42:02.706 --> 00:42:05.700
try all they can and do the best
they can to work with our secret

00:42:05.777 --> 00:42:07.777
service and work with our

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.581
chinatown leadership and our
chinatown. Three supervisor, our

00:42:12.784 --> 00:42:14.784
board PRESIDENT Aaron peskin,

00:42:15.219 --> 00:42:17.720
and also a lot of over a dozen
of key stakeholders for

00:42:18.222 --> 00:42:20.222
chinatown merchants and

00:42:20.357 --> 00:42:22.357
community groups. We had

00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:26.930
conducted numerous meetings and
communication is key and I

00:42:28.266 --> 00:42:30.266
really appreciate everyone under

00:42:30.768 --> 00:42:33.300
the leadership of jeff tomlin.
Also, I wanted to give a shout

00:42:33.605 --> 00:42:35.605
out to joel ramos, tony

00:42:36.374 --> 00:42:38.374
henderson, ian naimo rogerson,

00:42:40.647 --> 00:42:43.147
jesse lane, lulu phillips,
luciano. These are the team that

00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:46.216
actually bridge the gap between

00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:49.587
our language barrier to a lot of
chinese communities, not just

00:42:50.822 --> 00:42:53.424
within chinatown, but the ones
that actually goes to chinatown

00:42:54.325 --> 00:42:57.270
that that they are really,
really worried about. If they

00:42:58.364 --> 00:43:01.320
can will be blocked. So I'm
really appreciate it. And on

00:43:01.567 --> 00:43:03.567
behalf of our community, I

00:43:03.669 --> 00:43:06.236
really wanted to say thank you
to our agency and these

00:43:10.876 --> 00:43:13.444
dedicated staff. Thank you. Are
there other questions from my

00:43:13.645 --> 00:43:15.645
colleagues on the director's

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.480
report or comments? Director

00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:21.785
hemminger thank you, MADAM

00:43:23.822 --> 00:43:26.290
Chair. Jeff I wanted to ask you
about two numbers in your report

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:28.958
. The first one has to do with

00:43:29.628 --> 00:43:31.628
the ongoing saga of the fiscal

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:35.299
cliff and I believe you cited a

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.972
date of 2026, which is as a
result of getting more revenue

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.776
than you expected from mtc. We
could sort of push the envelope

00:43:45.778 --> 00:43:47.778
out that far. Yes, but not

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.916
without risk, as will be

00:43:52.185 --> 00:43:54.185
discussing at length in the

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.890
upcoming budget workshop. One of
the challenges that we face is

00:43:58.357 --> 00:44:00.357
the question about the

00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:02.493
likelihood of winning

00:44:02.495 --> 00:44:04.930
significant new operating
funding at the ballot in

00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:09.334
NOVEMBER of 26. So if we're

00:44:09.636 --> 00:44:11.636
highly confident that we're

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640
going to win there, then we can

00:44:15.641 --> 00:44:17.641
keep, maintain gaining this

00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.811
level of service s under the

00:44:19.846 --> 00:44:21.846
expectation that we can find

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.810
something to cover that one year

00:44:24.618 --> 00:44:26.619
gap. But if there's a risk of
not winning significant new

00:44:27.688 --> 00:44:29.688
operating funding at the ballot,

00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:31.957
then it changes the risk
equation significantly about

00:44:33.627 --> 00:44:35.627
when we would need to start

00:44:35.662 --> 00:44:37.662
trimming service s in order to

00:44:37.797 --> 00:44:39.797
live under the resources that we

00:44:42.403 --> 00:44:44.537
have today. I mean, candidly, I
don't think there can be much

00:44:44.772 --> 00:44:46.772
doubt that there's significant

00:44:46.907 --> 00:44:48.907
risk that we can't pass a

00:44:49.242 --> 00:44:51.242
measure such as that. It would

00:44:51.979 --> 00:44:54.714
be unprecedented to do so in the
bay area or probably anywhere

00:44:57.284 --> 00:44:59.284
else. I'm trying to get a

00:44:59.687 --> 00:45:01.687
clearer picture of the variables

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.725
that are driving this. And
obviously one of them is we lost

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.228
ridership ship, which means we
lost fare revenue during the

00:45:09.596 --> 00:45:11.596
pandemic. Our ridership though,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.200
is back up in the 70% range,

00:45:15.302 --> 00:45:17.302
isn't it? It's just below 70.

00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:19.905
And our fare revenue lags behind

00:45:20.808 --> 00:45:22.808
that by about 10. And then

00:45:23.444 --> 00:45:25.444
there's the general fund and is

00:45:27.526 --> 00:45:29.482
that the bigger thing we need to
worry about for example, I mean,

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.650
with two more years under our

00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:35.388
belt, do we get over 70? Do we
get up to 80? What's your

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.240
forecast there? So the

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.895
expectation for the general fund
is a decline in general fund

00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:44.196
resources, both in real dollars,

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:47.801
but particularly compared to how
our operating expenses are

00:45:49.803 --> 00:45:51.803
rising. So both are a threat.

00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:55.342
And again, these will be numbers
that we will be presenting to

00:45:56.444 --> 00:45:58.479
you in great detail soon. In
fact, we've been talking about

00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:02.649
how, how, how to present this

00:46:02.884 --> 00:46:04.585
complexity in a way that is
understandable, not only to you

00:46:05.453 --> 00:46:07.453
all as experts, but also to the

00:46:08.356 --> 00:46:10.725
general public. Well, and I know
we've gone back and forth a

00:46:10.725 --> 00:46:12.725
little bit about the

00:46:13.462 --> 00:46:15.462
nomenclature we use to describe

00:46:16.364 --> 00:46:18.364
this. But I mean, my experience

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500
has been that transit has always

00:46:22.604 --> 00:46:25.405
lived hand-to-mouth and there's
always been an operating

00:46:26.174 --> 00:46:28.174
shortfall to deal with.

00:46:28.477 --> 00:46:31.412
Obviously, nothing as severe as
this. So I don't want to
minimize the challenge we're

00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:34.881
facing, but I think it's

00:46:35.717 --> 00:46:37.717
important to show people in the

00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:41.289
context of a system that has
always required heavy subsidy

00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:46.226
and always somehow finds a way

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.198
to make things work. We've got a
challenge on top of that, but

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.670
it's not as if this industry or

00:46:53.669 --> 00:46:55.669
this system is unused to

00:46:55.738 --> 00:46:57.805
challenges. It's sort of lived
in a challenging budget

00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:02.109
environment for most of its life
. That is right. However one of

00:47:04.747 --> 00:47:06.348
the things that we are trying to
do is to not gut maintenance.

00:47:06.749 --> 00:47:08.749
This in order to balance our

00:47:09.218 --> 00:47:12.187
books. So the revenue shortfalls
that we have faced in the past,

00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:15.690
we have papered over by gutting
maintenance and therefore

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:19.594
degrading the quality of service
over time. We are trying to

00:47:20.697 --> 00:47:22.665
reverse that and actually invest
in proper maintenance of the

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.401
system. Um, I believe that the
public has responded very

00:47:27.537 --> 00:47:29.538
strongly to our emphasis on
particularly cleanliness and

00:47:31.941 --> 00:47:34.876
reliability. And so I don't want
to get back into a cycle of

00:47:35.812 --> 00:47:37.947
gutting maintenance in order to
pay for, oh no, we certainly

00:47:38.682 --> 00:47:41.584
don't. And I'll tell you
personally, I really have not

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.120
seen the system in as good a

00:47:45.288 --> 00:47:47.389
shape as it is for a long time.
Now, part of that is we don't

00:47:48.591 --> 00:47:51.360
have as many crowds and we'd
like to fix that problem. But

00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:54.495
but I think you're to be

00:47:55.332 --> 00:47:57.332
commended for holding the line

00:47:57.534 --> 00:47:59.534
on that. And I know we and

00:47:59.937 --> 00:48:02.338
others can be tempted to say,
oh, just this one little new

00:48:04.374 --> 00:48:06.374
operating expense. Yes. And so I

00:48:08.378 --> 00:48:11.280
appreciate that. And I'll save
the rest of my questions for the

00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:13.615
workshop, which is going to be

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.688
when julie, the board workshop,
I believe it's JANUARY 30th.

00:48:20.257 --> 00:48:23.159
Okay. Thank you. And the second
question is, I hope a lot

00:48:24.127 --> 00:48:26.662
shorter both the question and
the answer. Maybe about

00:48:28.799 --> 00:48:30.799
bikeshare. And here I forgot the

00:48:32.303 --> 00:48:34.303
number. What you said, how much

00:48:34.407 --> 00:48:36.407
of the bikeshare patty ronage is

00:48:37.975 --> 00:48:40.176
in san francisco? More than 80%
of the region. Wide bay wheels

00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:44.314
trips are in san francisco. And
look, I would expect it to be

00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:48.585
the lion's share, but. But do
you have a sense and evaluation

00:48:51.322 --> 00:48:54.258
about why oakland and san jose
aren't doing better? I mean,

00:48:55.193 --> 00:48:57.160
it's partly land use and it's
partly transportation in san

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.290
francisco has significantly

00:49:00.631 --> 00:49:02.632
higher density and therefore
vastly more people within

00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:05.401
walking distance of a bikeshare

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.470
station. And in addition, the

00:49:08.406 --> 00:49:11.342
investments that we've made in
in bike infrastructure in our

00:49:12.744 --> 00:49:15.112
neighborhoods is also paying
off. You know, while we MAY have

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.618
lost commuter bike riders like
we've lost commuter transit
riders, those trips have

00:49:22.921 --> 00:49:25.823
significantly increased in san
francisco neighborhoods, which

00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:28.325
is why we're committed to
continuing those investments

00:49:28.326 --> 00:49:30.326
through our active community

00:49:30.328 --> 00:49:32.196
strategy. Well, and as you
pointed out, I mean, the fact

00:49:33.164 --> 00:49:35.164
that electric bikes sort of

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.768
flatten the hills of san
francisco, san jose's already

00:49:39.505 --> 00:49:41.505
flat. So we're sort of giving

00:49:42.141 --> 00:49:44.141
ourselves another advantage by

00:49:44.576 --> 00:49:46.576
change, changing our geography

00:49:47.312 --> 00:49:49.312
and I sure hope the debate that

00:49:49.915 --> 00:49:52.683
we're going to have about the
richmond-san rafael bridge,
which takes that into account

00:49:56.154 --> 00:49:58.724
because there it's as if we're
going to be pedaling across the

00:49:59.825 --> 00:50:01.825
bridge and in many respects,

00:50:02.962 --> 00:50:05.296
it'll be a different kind of
rider experience. Thank you,

00:50:05.931 --> 00:50:08.733
MADAM Chair. Thank you. Other
colleagues, do you have any

00:50:08.834 --> 00:50:10.834
questions on the director's

00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:15.605
report? Okay. Seeing none, we

00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:18.410
will open to a public comment on
the items covered in the

00:50:19.612 --> 00:50:21.612
director's report. For anyone in

00:50:24.484 --> 00:50:26.785
the room. Good afternoon. I keep
maggie glasses. I'm a bit tired.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.870
Uh I do not think this is the

00:50:31.123 --> 00:50:33.392
future what you're talking
about. I'm sorry. Because the

00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:36.461
future you see is to make

00:50:37.397 --> 00:50:39.397
everybody happy. So so it means

00:50:43.302 --> 00:50:45.537
that bike. Yes. Yes. Okay, fine.
We can use bikes. But, you know,

00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:48.272
san francisco is not hamsterdam.

00:50:49.409 --> 00:50:52.311
It's not so it's pretty clear
that pushing this agenda for

00:50:55.148 --> 00:50:57.148
bikes is to limit the ability

00:50:57.217 --> 00:50:59.217
for people to move because then

00:50:59.252 --> 00:51:02.870
you can have you have limited
staff, you can put on your bike.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.590
So since the future is about no

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.250
more weaponization of anything,

00:51:08.228 --> 00:51:10.228
including community action, like

00:51:10.697 --> 00:51:12.697
the phone you see, you have to

00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:14.699
work for that. I don't know how

00:51:15.235 --> 00:51:18.700
to put it. I'm sorry. I'm like
hands on decks. For example, in

00:51:18.238 --> 00:51:20.238
the bus you can put jokes

00:51:20.909 --> 00:51:23.420
instead of bad harassment is
unacceptable. Yes, we know that.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:25.910
But so don't harass people with

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.816
that push a joke. I don't know.
I've got one here. What's the

00:51:30.184 --> 00:51:32.485
difference between a surgeon
wearing a mask and somebody

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.320
else? I don't know. It's a fun

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.240
joke to me. I'm sorry, guys. I

00:51:39.726 --> 00:51:41.627
don't want to be the bad guy
coming or giving you bad news.

00:51:42.329 --> 00:51:44.329
But what you're talking about is

00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:47.833
not the future. I guarantee you.

00:51:53.307 --> 00:51:55.307
Thank you. Next speaker, please.

00:51:55.643 --> 00:51:57.643
Good afternoon, directors. Is

00:51:57.678 --> 00:51:59.678
director tomlin. I'm mark

00:51:59.847 --> 00:52:02.683
gleason. I'm here speaking on
behalf of teamsters joint

00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:06.720
council seven and our affiliates
and our coalition partners about

00:52:07.855 --> 00:52:09.855
the issue around autonomous

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.859
vehicles, which was reported
this year. Our trade union

00:52:12.926 --> 00:52:14.926
partners have been in the

00:52:15.229 --> 00:52:17.698
forefront of the call for safety
regulations, regulations of

00:52:17.899 --> 00:52:19.899
autonomous vehicles.

00:52:20.435 --> 00:52:23.270
Unfortunately and tragically, a
number of incidents this year

00:52:25.406 --> 00:52:27.174
have occurred that alarms city
residents alarm first

00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:30.109
responders. And finally, the

00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:33.213
department of motor vehicles,
which is charged with ultimate

00:52:35.884 --> 00:52:37.884
regulatory oversight of av

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.588
cruise, has now been shut down
by the dmv as reported, the

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.226
behavior of the other prominent
operator, waymo unfortunately

00:52:46.594 --> 00:52:48.594
resulted in the death of a dog

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.530
earlier this year. We applaud

00:52:52.134 --> 00:52:54.802
city attorney david chu for
taking the lead on this issue,

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.973
challenging the state decision
that allowed for this experiment

00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:02.777
with street safety to be foisted
upon metropolitan residents,

00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:05.545
metropolitan residents

00:53:05.847 --> 00:53:08.480
throughout california. Indeed
the mayor of los angeles and

00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:10.986
other prominent elected
officials are following our city

00:53:11.887 --> 00:53:13.887
attorney's lead and calling out

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.925
the dangerous aspects of tech
experimentation on our roadways.

00:53:19.862 --> 00:53:21.862
Under the circumstances. Av

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.932
experimentation on our streets
does not align with this

00:53:25.701 --> 00:53:28.337
agency's core values in our
opinion, including the

00:53:29.138 --> 00:53:32.107
improvement expansion and
resource retention of public

00:53:33.576 --> 00:53:36.244
transit, diverse agencies and
departments of our city are

00:53:36.412 --> 00:53:38.980
aligning with the leadership of
our elected representatives in

00:53:39.381 --> 00:53:41.381
questioning and challenging the

00:53:41.417 --> 00:53:44.180
driverless autonomous experiment
happening on our streets. We

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:50.292
strongly urge the mta mta to
join our city's leadership and

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.995
essential agencies in this
effort. Thank you. Thank you.

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.236
next speaker, please. Hi, stacy

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.600
randecker. Wow, what a fun, fun

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:10.380
meeting. So I'll go backwards. I
will. Thanks to the teamsters

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.380
for highlighting that the issue

00:54:12.648 --> 00:54:15.551
is not actually a safety issue.
It's a labor issue. That is what

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:22.124
is at heart here. And I wish

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:24.593
that the agency would be more

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:26.795
broad minded, especially when I

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:31.733
see this kick ass mechanic over
here. We will need we have so

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.380
many jobs to do, no matter about
who's doing the driving. And we

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:40.776
need this city to be safer for

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.147
the and we need to not pay out
so much in lawsuits for what has

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:47.682
happened through injury or death

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.453
due to our muni drivers. Apec

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.560
wayfinding. I'm just hoping that

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.600
and I would say this to every

00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.597
city agency that's all that's
getting all cleaned up for our

00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:05.168
guests and stuff is just to take
some of it and make sure that we

00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:08.571
do it for our own as well that
are still here after the event,

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.372
that we have it clean and

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:14.244
wonderful and people able to
find their way and make it easy

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:20.617
to take transit at the
bikeshare. I'm thrilled that

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.510
we'll be finally getting more

00:55:25.156 --> 00:55:27.156
money and as a very frequent

00:55:27.224 --> 00:55:30.600
rider throughout the bay area, I
would say that everyone drives

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.980
in san jose and both the

00:55:35.133 --> 00:55:37.267
maintenance of the classic bikes
the non electric bikes because

00:55:37.402 --> 00:55:39.402
they haven't had electric bikes

00:55:39.604 --> 00:55:41.604
in those markets. It makes them

00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:43.739
like very less attractive to

00:55:44.242 --> 00:55:46.242
take. And then the trolley

00:55:46.277 --> 00:55:48.312
busses. I'm so glad that we're
sort of coming around on trolley

00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:51.749
busses. It's a much you said it
beautifully director tomlin like

00:55:53.618 --> 00:55:55.819
that is the way it is the most
efficient thing that we are

00:55:56.955 --> 00:55:59.823
getting this beautiful renewable
power. And it's we don't need

00:56:00.392 --> 00:56:02.392
the big batteries. So yay, I'm

00:56:02.527 --> 00:56:04.527
glad we're on the bus. Thanks

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.900
thank you. Next speaker, please.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.136
Good afternoon. My name is pete
wilson. I'm executive vice

00:56:14.473 --> 00:56:17.308
PRESIDENT For local 250. Lydia
congratulations. Katrina is an

00:56:18.276 --> 00:56:20.878
excellent coach, but just a
little bit of warning. I know we

00:56:20.979 --> 00:56:22.979
are looking for operators. If

00:56:23.149 --> 00:56:25.183
you come and you pull two feet
away from the curb, you will get

00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:27.986
written up. So you have to
practice that. Okay director

00:56:29.154 --> 00:56:31.122
tomlin, it's going to be quite
the challenge this next week

00:56:33.525 --> 00:56:35.525
with all these people come. I've

00:56:37.729 --> 00:56:40.265
driven one night I drove the one
california and PRESIDENT Obama

00:56:41.167 --> 00:56:43.167
was in town, of course, staying

00:56:43.936 --> 00:56:46.237
at the fairmont. And so we had
to reroute and go around and do

00:56:47.406 --> 00:56:49.641
all that. You're having. It's
going to be like 20 presidents

00:56:50.276 --> 00:56:52.276
coming in and reroutes and all

00:56:52.478 --> 00:56:54.478
that. And what I'm asking as my

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.480
way over here from flynn

00:56:56.783 --> 00:56:59.318
division, I saw an inspector
sitting in the truck watching

00:57:00.286 --> 00:57:02.286
probably the nine and the 1414

00:57:02.555 --> 00:57:04.823
go by and I'm like, what are
they doing? I wonder, sitting in

00:57:05.158 --> 00:57:07.158
that truck checking times, I

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.427
know our computers can check
their times. So one thing that I

00:57:09.629 --> 00:57:11.896
didn't get that much when I was
operating is very many

00:57:12.698 --> 00:57:15.167
inspectors coming up and saying,
hey, do you need some help? Is

00:57:16.102 --> 00:57:18.104
there any way I can help you?
What's going on? And I

00:57:18.405 --> 00:57:20.405
understand that it's stressful

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.510
time, probably a stressful time
for you, even though you seem to
handle stress pretty well.
Stressful time for the managers,

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:27.246
supervisors and everybody. I'm
just asking for patience, you

00:57:28.715 --> 00:57:30.682
know, I'm asking for the
supervisors just because

00:57:31.285 --> 00:57:33.285
somebody's 20 minutes late, half

00:57:34.388 --> 00:57:37.890
an hour late, you know, your
team, the schedule is probably a

00:57:38.358 --> 00:57:40.358
great job of trying to adapt the

00:57:41.294 --> 00:57:43.295
schedules and we don't know what
it's going to be like. We

00:57:44.564 --> 00:57:46.832
haven't had it since 1945, and
that was 1945. So I would just

00:57:47.667 --> 00:57:50.103
appreciate if you could pass it
on down and julie could pass it

00:57:50.504 --> 00:57:53.306
on down to people. Just please
be patient. It's going to be

00:57:53.373 --> 00:57:55.373
it's going to be crazy. So thank

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.215
you. Thank you. Next speaker.
Hi, board members. Luke

00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:06.417
bornheimer related to the cruise

00:58:07.522 --> 00:58:09.522
disaster. I would love to just

00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:11.557
pass on a comment in case the

00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:14.227
ceo of cruise, kyle voight, is
listening. Gm board members. Gm

00:58:14.962 --> 00:58:17.730
is the parent company of cruise
or other venture capitalists who

00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:20.666
are investing in autonomous
vehicles. We have an underfunded

00:58:21.535 --> 00:58:23.535
transportation agency and rather

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.720
than figuratively be lighting

00:58:26.707 --> 00:58:28.742
money on fire to fund cruise,
they could help fund sfmta. So I

00:58:29.477 --> 00:58:31.477
would encourage those venture

00:58:31.612 --> 00:58:33.847
capitalists to look at sfmta in
the city and maybe invest that

00:58:34.782 --> 00:58:36.782
money to help us build a better

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.219
transportation system. Thank you
. Thank you. Are there any other

00:58:40.387 --> 00:58:42.589
speakers in the room? This is
for the directors report

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:45.250
comments on items in the
director's report item seven.

00:58:46.995 --> 00:58:49.963
Okay seeing none, please open
the remote at this time. We'll

00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:53.660
move to remote public comment
not to exceed a total time of

00:58:53.207 --> 00:58:55.207
ten minutes. Members of the

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.271

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.840
two minutes. Moderator first

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:09.815
speaker. This is herbert weiner.

00:59:11.152 --> 00:59:13.152
My concern is, is that we have

00:59:14.389 --> 00:59:17.325
more trolleys because because
trolleys has been playing out

00:59:17.626 --> 00:59:19.626
are good system of

00:59:21.896 --> 00:59:24.765
transportation and that should
the trolley should also reflect

00:59:27.436 --> 00:59:29.436
the density of the city so that

00:59:29.838 --> 00:59:32.673
should be part and parcel of
adding more busses to the fleet.

00:59:33.943 --> 00:59:35.943
Thank you. Thank you. Next

00:59:41.383 --> 00:59:43.383
speaker. Hello good afternoon.

00:59:44.353 --> 00:59:47.540
This is barry toronto. I just
want to first say that it was a

00:59:49.558 --> 00:59:51.558
really nice tribute and honor

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.830
that you gave to manny yaqoob

00:59:57.299 --> 00:59:59.501
for his service and for the
ideas he brought to the board.

01:00:03.238 --> 01:00:05.238
So thank you for the how you

01:00:05.274 --> 01:00:07.274
handled his departure. I want to

01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:10.945
talk about apec. I think it's

01:00:13.149 --> 01:00:15.149
important that you you keep the

01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:17.551
taxi staff informed and educated

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.720
on on what's happening and to

01:00:21.224 --> 01:00:23.358
create and to and to let us know
where you're going to put the

01:00:24.226 --> 01:00:26.928
temporary taxi zones in a timely
manner and to have them also

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.310
there's a problem. 801 howard

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.770
and all the housing behind and
on the south of moscone center

01:00:36.506 --> 01:00:38.506
has disabled people. So the

01:00:39.175 --> 01:00:41.175
least you could do is vet the

01:00:42.211 --> 01:00:44.914
most of the ramp drivers so that
they have access to these

01:00:45.515 --> 01:00:48.150
buildings. So people in
wheelchairs should not be put

01:00:49.853 --> 01:00:51.853
out because of this event. So I

01:00:52.355 --> 01:00:54.355
beg you to make sure that the

01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:56.424
ramp taxis have access to these

01:00:56.493 --> 01:00:59.261
buildings that house disabled
people within the closed off

01:01:00.296 --> 01:01:02.296
area. Thank you very much. Thank

01:01:04.435 --> 01:01:07.370
you. No additional speakers.
Okay. Close public comment.

01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:10.139

report. We have no report that
places you on item number nine.

01:01:15.345 --> 01:01:17.446
General public comment. Members

calendar. And I do have some

01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:26.488
speaker cards and anthony

01:01:33.363 --> 01:01:35.363
ballester, fred m mark gleason.

01:01:35.465 --> 01:01:38.402
MADAM Chair, directors director
tomlin, my name is anthony

01:01:39.437 --> 01:01:41.471
ballester. I am PRESIDENT Of
transport workers union local

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.908
250, a and I the first thing I

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:48.811
want to say that I work with
julie very well and work with

01:01:49.513 --> 01:01:51.548
jeff very well and of course
there are things that we

01:01:51.915 --> 01:01:53.915
disagree with and that's why I'm

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.754
here. Of course, I know that you
received the emails. I've sent

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:59.656
and I appreciate that. And I
know you read them so most

01:02:00.491 --> 01:02:02.491
important thing about I'm here

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.562
is about senior operators like
director solis said, that

01:02:06.464 --> 01:02:08.464
they've been here for 15, 20, 25

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.900
years, 30 years. Our members

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:13.936
don't go on vacation for 2 or 3

01:02:14.706 --> 01:02:16.840
years, four years at a time. So
when they do have an opportunity

01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:20.578
to go on vacation, they go for
six, seven, eight weeks. Now the

01:02:20.578 --> 01:02:22.913
agency is holding them down just
two, four weeks after being

01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:25.781
here, 15, 20 years. That's just

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.783
disrespectful. And it's always

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:29.785
been past practice and there's

01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:32.522
no limit on how many weeks can

01:02:34.993 --> 01:02:36.993
be taken. And city charter.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.796
Eight for 40 or and our in our

01:02:44.402 --> 01:02:46.402
mou. Section 13.5 paragraph 170.

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.407
And they agency did not bargain
in good faith and they've

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:52.309
continued this practice for

01:02:52.878 --> 01:02:54.878
quite a while. You know, I don't

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.380
mean any disrespect to julie or

01:02:57.382 --> 01:03:00.351
jeff, but mid-level management
are always telling us what

01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:03.154
they're going to do. And when we
want to change something, they

01:03:03.856 --> 01:03:05.856
don't allow us. And this is the

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:08.393
way management is going to act.
why are we going through
contract negotiations? We're

01:03:10.362 --> 01:03:12.530
going to have a hard time. So
that's the first thing I want to

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:15.133
do. I want to our senior
operators to take time to go

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.736
back to home country, whether
it's china or india. You know,

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.241
they need that time. So I like
that change. One more other

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.744
thing, another email that I sent
is regarding this policy about

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.460
supervisors looking into bags,

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:32.550
purses. I mean, are you going to

01:03:32.585 --> 01:03:34.954
allow us managers go to a
woman's purse and look at her

01:03:34.954 --> 01:03:37.880
feminine hygiene products just
because they want to check her

01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:40.659
phone? Just trust them. Their
phone is off and you know, and

01:03:41.795 --> 01:03:44.960
it's stowed. You know, you don't
got to go into women's property

01:03:44.632 --> 01:03:46.765
and look at a bag or even a
gentleman's property. This is

01:03:47.467 --> 01:03:50.301
wrong. So I want to kill this
before it gets going. Thank you.

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:52.804
Thank you. Thanks for your
sharing your comments. Next

01:03:59.446 --> 01:04:02.248
speaker, please. Hello thank you
so much for allowing my public

01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:06.417
comment. I have a son at lowell

01:04:07.187 --> 01:04:09.188
high school and on our listserv
we started talking about

01:04:10.156 --> 01:04:12.724
somebody said, has anybody else
had problems, problems with the

01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.610
bus, skipping them on the 48. We

01:04:16.997 --> 01:04:18.997
are at the end of the 48, so we

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.834
don't have problems with the bus
skipping us. But we have a

01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:24.469
problem that it takes an hour

01:04:24.638 --> 01:04:26.639
and a half or maybe an hour and
45 minutes to get to school. All

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.975
the 48 also goes to soda. It
goes to lincoln. It's skipping

01:04:31.512 --> 01:04:33.680
students on the way to school.
It's taking 20, 30 minutes

01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:36.849
longer than it's supposed to.

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:38.917
When this came up, people said,

01:04:39.586 --> 01:04:41.586
oh, I don't have that on the 48,

01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:44.123
but I've got it on the 23. I've
got it on the 28, I've got it on

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.596
the 44. So who do we want to get
to? How do we want our students

01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:51.797
to get to school? Obviously we

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:54.166
want them to take the bus making

01:04:55.236 --> 01:04:57.236
that bus reliable, making it get

01:04:58.372 --> 01:05:01.340
there on time, make making it
have space for these students.

01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:04.810
It's critical and we would be

01:05:05.479 --> 01:05:07.481
happy. A bunch of parents from
lowell would be happy to work

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:10.116
with you guys. We also know

01:05:10.785 --> 01:05:12.785
parents at soda and lincoln and

01:05:13.154 --> 01:05:15.956
other schools and come up with a
list of routes that need

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:21.227
attention on and we'd love to
help you make this better for

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.650
our students. Thank you. If I

01:05:26.668 --> 01:05:28.702
MAY, I usually don't address the
audience. So this is a very

01:05:29.237 --> 01:05:32.720
important issue to us. We have
all of the data on our crowding

01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:36.710
and performance. One of the most
important things that we all

01:05:36.744 --> 01:05:39.379
could do together is to work
with the school district to

01:05:40.949 --> 01:05:43.500
stagger school, start times.
This has been one of our

01:05:43.385 --> 01:05:45.987
greatest challenges, and our
transit team is here who've been

01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:49.657
trying to work with the school
district so far without success,

01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:53.560
as I hope you know, we are in
the worst financial crisis in

01:05:54.362 --> 01:05:57.131
our agency's history. We
reallocated much of our downtown

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.990
service to augment service to

01:06:01.203 --> 01:06:03.203
school, but now we need help

01:06:04.206 --> 01:06:06.206
with scheduling because we have

01:06:06.241 --> 01:06:09.110
a we have a problem of success
with an unprecedented number of

01:06:10.145 --> 01:06:13.140
kids using muni in order to get
to school, which is great. It is

01:06:13.115 --> 01:06:15.115
problematic that they all need

01:06:15.317 --> 01:06:17.317
to get to school at exactly the

01:06:17.553 --> 01:06:19.620
same time. Right. I mean, the
they're the middle schools. Are

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:22.990
we can't really engage in a okay

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:26.127
sorry. Well yeah. Anyway I'm
happy to work with you guys

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:28.695
about it. Thank you for raising

01:06:34.637 --> 01:06:36.938
that issue. Next speaker please.
I also have a speaker card for

01:06:40.276 --> 01:06:43.245
stacy randecker. I'm one of
those little moms to the. Yeah,

01:06:46.115 --> 01:06:48.283
so whatever we can do, I know
that there will be other people

01:06:48.918 --> 01:06:50.918
online also addressing this. But

01:06:53.623 --> 01:06:56.224
what it really for me is I know
that transit is our first

01:06:58.561 --> 01:07:00.762
priority here. We say it all the
time. We say we're a transit

01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:03.531
first city, but I'd really like

01:07:03.566 --> 01:07:05.566
us to think about when we're

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:09.370
making decisions about how

01:07:11.775 --> 01:07:14.710
people get around and that we
take into consideration all the

01:07:16.479 --> 01:07:18.479
principles that that are transit

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:21.450
first principles and that we let
walking and biking also be

01:07:22.652 --> 01:07:25.253
viable options. I am so
concerned about all of the

01:07:26.423 --> 01:07:28.423
decisions that are made that are

01:07:28.525 --> 01:07:31.194
to preserve parking to not annoy
motorists, to make sure that

01:07:32.596 --> 01:07:35.131
everybody is okay and they get
to park for free and it's just

01:07:37.267 --> 01:07:39.267
it's mind blowing when it is

01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:41.636
juxtaposed with the toll that is

01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:45.308
taken in injuries in
intimidation, in deaths on our

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.610
streets of pedestrians, people

01:07:49.513 --> 01:07:51.381
just walking on the sidewalk and
they're mowed down, people

01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:58.220
wanting. I can't let my 16 year
old son I have to think about

01:07:58.421 --> 01:08:01.290
him getting a driver's license.
I don't want him to. But it is

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.360
just not safe enough for him to

01:08:04.762 --> 01:08:07.564
bike. We have to do better. We
have to make this. We have to

01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:11.367
actually give the lanes, give
the space, give the budget to

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:15.370
making transit sing, to making

01:08:16.173 --> 01:08:18.173
biking and option so that we

01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:21.378
keep and that we make it harder
for drivers. I'm sorry, there's

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.979
no other way around it. And our

01:08:23.981 --> 01:08:25.981
city needs it. Our planet needs

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:29.385
it. Please do what you can to
really be transit first. Thank

01:08:31.389 --> 01:08:34.124
you. Thank you. Are there other
speakers in the room for general

01:08:34.325 --> 01:08:36.325
public comment? I do have more

01:08:38.663 --> 01:08:40.663
speaker cards. Yeah. Lucy wang.

01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:42.965
Lee chen li. Jenny wendy liu.

01:08:43.134 --> 01:08:45.134
Lee chung. Josephine it's okay,

01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:49.172
sir. You can go ahead. Okay I
wasn't quite sure how this

01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:52.853
works. It's my first time here
at this board meeting. I'm fred
mu

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.460
lheim. I'm a 50 year resident

01:08:56.948 --> 01:08:59.316
of the city and a long term
advocate community advocate for

01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:02.184
city college of san francisco. I

01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:06.390
love muni. I use it every day.
It takes me reliably where I

01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:10.459
need to go. I love the van ness

01:09:10.629 --> 01:09:12.629
carter improvements and I'm

01:09:12.965 --> 01:09:15.800
always behind getting vehicles
off the streets when it makes

01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:18.568
sense. I'm here to share

01:09:18.903 --> 01:09:21.572
concerns about the frida kahlo
quick build project with you

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:25.476
that I'm hearing from all the
constituents at city college and

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.578
from many surrounding

01:09:28.681 --> 01:09:31.516
neighborhoods. One, they feel
that the project is going ahead

01:09:32.785 --> 01:09:34.785
way too fast and that their

01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:37.788
inputs haven't been sought out
or listened to, particularly on

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.920
the side of the college, which

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960
is now developing the new steam

01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:48.332
building. The diego rivera

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.100
theater is going to be going in

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.270
and the college is going to be

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.941
losing 1100 spaces of parking
with the balboa reservoir

01:09:57.643 --> 01:09:59.643
project. It's kind of the

01:09:59.979 --> 01:10:01.979
elephant in the room is that

01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:05.984
it's a commuter school. Some of

01:10:06.653 --> 01:10:08.653
the students have to drive to

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:12.424
get there. So we have to provide
some parking for them. If you

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.862
are and it's been said, well,
it's only 50 parking spaces that

01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:21.767
are going to go away. But those
are parking spaces that turn

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.970
over for multiple times a day.

01:10:26.873 --> 01:10:28.873
And students don't go there

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.443
every day of the week. So it's
affecting taking educational

01:10:32.512 --> 01:10:35.213
opportunity away from hundreds
of students. We also have

01:10:36.683 --> 01:10:38.683
concerns about not increased

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.120
backup on frida kahlo way by

01:10:42.255 --> 01:10:44.255
moving bus stops from the curb

01:10:45.592 --> 01:10:48.294
into bus islands where the
busses will be in the main

01:10:49.296 --> 01:10:51.296
traffic lane and traffic will

01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:53.531
have to stop behind them. We

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200
also feel that is your time.

01:10:56.403 --> 01:10:58.605
Okay, thank you. There are many
points and thank you for your

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.574

please. This is non agenda items

01:17:05.345 --> 01:17:07.345
Thank you so much. My name is

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:10.215
rex ridgeway. I am with abraham
lincoln high school and about an

01:17:10.984 --> 01:17:13.180
hour and a half ago our
assistant principal sent an

01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:16.870
email and I'll just quickly read

01:17:16.589 --> 01:17:18.589
it. I am reaching out to you as

01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:20.225
one of the assistant principals
of abraham lincoln high school.

01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.830
I have ceased. Director
ridgeway, ask me the other

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:27.199
assistant principal, jordan
lewis, and forwarding this

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.670
message that I sent to engardio

01:17:32.939 --> 01:17:34.939
office regarding the frustrating

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800
that continues with the 48. Not

01:17:37.878 --> 01:17:39.878
only is the 48 continuing to

01:17:41.749 --> 01:17:44.717
pass up our kids, but I myself
was a student. Have been passed

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.620
up so I won't read read it

01:17:48.922 --> 01:17:51.657
basically I met with him today.
They asked me if I could rush

01:17:52.426 --> 01:17:54.693
down here, at least be a face
again. You've seen me before and

01:17:55.663 --> 01:17:57.663
I know you can't add a bus, but

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.133
maybe a longer bus. But we're

01:18:01.402 --> 01:18:04.170
really, really struggling with
this. The term is pass ups and

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:07.239
we're continuing to deal with

01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:10.509
them. Any help would be really

01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:12.911
appreciated. So that's why I'm

01:18:12.914 --> 01:18:14.982
here. Thank you. Thank you for
flagging. Someone else raised

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.919
that today. And I believe our
staff were able to talk to them

01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:21.554
in the hallway. So I don't know
if director kirshbaum or kennedy

01:18:23.124 --> 01:18:25.124
are here, but we can maybe have

01:18:25.893 --> 01:18:27.893
them connect with you as well.

01:18:31.533 --> 01:18:33.533
Next speaker, please. Hi, my

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.360
name is julia toscano and I'm

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.720
here to talk about the parking

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.440
restrictions in nearby high sfsu
san francisco state university.

01:18:46.814 --> 01:18:49.685
So I, as a student of san
francisco state university, I
live in the parkmerced

01:18:49.685 --> 01:18:51.685
apartments right across the

01:18:52.854 --> 01:18:54.854
street, and I have $5,000 worth

01:18:55.123 --> 01:18:57.791
of parking citations because I
was unsuccessfully able to

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:01.395
receive a permit from the city
so I could park in front of my

01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.698
own home. They required a

01:19:05.868 --> 01:19:08.603
utility bill, which is split
between my roommates, so it's

01:19:09.405 --> 01:19:11.405
not in my name. I offered a

01:19:13.141 --> 01:19:16.430
proof of address from the post
office I was offering other

01:19:17.179 --> 01:19:19.179
various forms of proof of

01:19:21.383 --> 01:19:23.383
address, but it was denied my by

01:19:25.688 --> 01:19:27.755
a I think, $5,000 just for
parking in front of my own home

01:19:28.924 --> 01:19:31.826
as a student is just ridiculous.
It's outrageous. The parking

01:19:31.827 --> 01:19:33.827
restrictions in san francisco

01:19:34.463 --> 01:19:36.463
just to go to school, to go to

01:19:36.565 --> 01:19:38.565
the doctor, to go grocery

01:19:40.269 --> 01:19:42.269
shopping, to do normal daily

01:19:42.505 --> 01:19:45.340
life things, you have to pay pay
so much just to park and just to

01:19:48.444 --> 01:19:50.444
live here in the city. And I was

01:19:50.713 --> 01:19:52.713
on my way to the hospital all

01:19:53.482 --> 01:19:55.482
last week and I was pulled over

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.180
in tenderloin between hyde and

01:19:58.488 --> 01:20:00.488
larkin, the highest homeless and

01:20:01.357 --> 01:20:03.357
population in crime in the

01:20:04.394 --> 01:20:06.394
entire city by chp. And they

01:20:07.163 --> 01:20:09.163
towed my car right then and

01:20:10.466 --> 01:20:12.634
there. So I no longer have a car
. And it's all because of these

01:20:12.702 --> 01:20:14.702
outrageous parking restrictions.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
So that's all I came here to

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:20.743
speak on today. Thank you for
sharing your experience. Next

01:20:26.482 --> 01:20:29.510
speaker, please. Hi. My name is
jenny and I drive my car every

01:20:30.253 --> 01:20:33.540
day. We're living in san
francisco and somehow every

01:20:34.157 --> 01:20:36.159
house on my block has 3 to 4
cars. So parking in front of my

01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:39.662
own house is difficult. Almost
every day, especially on sunday,

01:20:40.263 --> 01:20:42.431
when everybody is home. I'm just
asking for maybe more side angle

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.700
parking. Like I feel like a spot

01:20:45.835 --> 01:20:47.835
in the big sunset streets could

01:20:48.671 --> 01:20:50.671
fit like 2 or 3 side angled or

01:20:50.808 --> 01:20:53.900
back in parking and I feel like
that would be very helpful to

01:20:54.712 --> 01:20:56.312
those of us who drive. Thank you
. Thank you. Next speaker,

01:21:01.918 --> 01:21:03.918
please. Hello again. My name is

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.880
pete wilson, local 258. We

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.893
represent fare inspectors. We
are concerned about the way the

01:21:09.894 --> 01:21:11.894
fare inspectors are being

01:21:12.763 --> 01:21:15.131
treated. I had some talking to
some shop stewards for fare

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.835
inspectors and they were asked
by their managers and

01:21:19.737 --> 01:21:22.638
supervisors to do something they
were concerned about what was

01:21:23.106 --> 01:21:25.106
happening. So I asked the

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:27.277
manager to step outside the
manager and supervisor stepped

01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:30.514
outside. I talked to them. I
said, better to comply and not

01:21:30.615 --> 01:21:32.349
get written up for
insubordination and we'll talk

01:21:34.752 --> 01:21:36.752
about it later. We did then they

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.210
had a hearing and had the

01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:41.157
question the supervisor asked is
, what did your supervisor or

01:21:41.992 --> 01:21:44.795
excuse me, what did your union
representative, pete wilson, say

01:21:45.764 --> 01:21:48.432
to you to have you comply? And
that is illegal under the myers

01:21:49.567 --> 01:21:51.567
milius? Brown act. They should

01:21:51.803 --> 01:21:54.771
not be interfering with union
work. The other thing is it just

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.576
came out that they are telling
fare inspectors that they can

01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:02.512
never sit on a bus. The rule is

01:22:02.748 --> 01:22:05.215
if they're on a bus and people
are sitting down and they need

01:22:06.351 --> 01:22:08.419
seats, they can't sit. They've
always complied with that. But

01:22:09.287 --> 01:22:11.989
now they're telling them they
can never sit on a bus. So we're

01:22:12.257 --> 01:22:14.958
talking 2.5 hours straight. I
would suggest that some of you

01:22:15.159 --> 01:22:17.928
stand up every once in a while
and move around. It's good, but

01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:20.630
you also shouldn't be standing

01:22:20.265 --> 01:22:22.433
for hours straight. So I just
think that what's going on there

01:22:22.534 --> 01:22:25.269
is very sad, as anthony
ballester was talking earlier,

01:22:27.839 --> 01:22:29.839
the sfmta is forcing a change

01:22:30.275 --> 01:22:33.110
against our contract, saying
that people and by the way,

01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:36.115
lydia, you were speaking I think
you said yeah, you were maybe

01:22:36.115 --> 01:22:38.115
talking about rafael cabrera,

01:22:38.116 --> 01:22:41.850
who's a very he's number three.
He's a cable car operator. He's

01:22:41.854 --> 01:22:44.389
a senior operator. That guy can
have eight, ten weeks and he can

01:22:45.791 --> 01:22:47.525
go take it all. At one time they
were saying, well, the newer

01:22:48.293 --> 01:22:50.293
operators cannot. There are

01:22:50.962 --> 01:22:52.962
times that they can't sign up

01:22:53.232 --> 01:22:55.233
for vacation. So I asked where
that data was and the manager

01:22:56.736 --> 01:22:58.670
said, well, I can't give you
that data. It's just what I've

01:22:59.805 --> 01:23:02.741
heard here is the documentation
that proves that every single

01:23:03.576 --> 01:23:05.610
operator has an opportunity.
They just don't have the

01:23:06.878 --> 01:23:09.214
opportunity to sign up for the
weeks that they want your time.

01:23:10.784 --> 01:23:12.918
Here is the letter that they
wrote us, and I've got the

01:23:12.918 --> 01:23:15.787
untruths written on here. You
can enjoy that next speaker,

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:25.950
please. Dear commissioners and

01:23:25.164 --> 01:23:27.164
director, this is josephine.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.100
Very glad to be here for the

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:32.170
very first time. We represent

01:23:32.172 --> 01:23:35.740
that immigrants multi generation
family, the working poor

01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:39.477
majority of people that living
in and outside of chinatown in

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.780
the chinese community, we need

01:23:43.183 --> 01:23:45.183
cars to really make a difference

01:23:45.819 --> 01:23:47.819
in our life. We used to stay in

01:23:48.188 --> 01:23:50.188
sros in chinatown, very crappy

01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:53.125
housing situation for people
living in a room without toilets

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.160
and without kitchen. But with a

01:23:56.429 --> 01:23:59.164
car, we are able to move to a
further out neighborhoods that

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:02.833
we can get access to better

01:24:03.771 --> 01:24:06.539
schools, better work, and we can
start being self employed.

01:24:07.808 --> 01:24:09.808
Little business people, all

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.310
handyman bringing tools with our

01:24:13.213 --> 01:24:15.448
cars, starting to have a start,
having a contracting business

01:24:16.383 --> 01:24:18.383
and other businesses that will

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:22.555
make us self sufficient. The car
. Nowadays roles are not open

01:24:24.324 --> 01:24:26.324
and gray highway is closed for

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.620
commute. It adds a lot of burden
to our community and also

01:24:30.397 --> 01:24:33.990
parkings are being taken away by
many different reasons. Some are

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:36.368
necessary, but some like the

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:39.370
bike rental rack, can totally be

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:41.741
put on wider sidewalk in a 45
degrees. We can definitely use

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:44.777
more technology to ensure

01:24:46.447 --> 01:24:48.447
transit and person walker

01:24:48.449 --> 01:24:50.449
safety. We can be walker and bus

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.487
people. Any day, not just some
day. Some people will always

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.725
take bus and some people will
always drive. We are everything,

01:24:59.765 --> 01:25:01.765
every other day, every day. So

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:04.731
don't make us pit each other
against each other. Let's make

01:25:05.199 --> 01:25:07.199
sure that we bring in technology

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.369
to ensure safety, cross walks

01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:13.507
overhead, flash lights for
people walking across, and other

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.713
technology to ensure walkers
safety, biker safety and transit

01:25:20.481 --> 01:25:23.250
safety. We can do all for
everyone. We don't have to

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.220
choose and pick whom we serve.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.930
Next speaker, please. Hey board

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:40.101
members. Luke bornheimer have a
few things I want to touch upon

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.703
today. First, no turn on red as

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.773
you all know, last year we had
39 roadway deaths in our city.

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:49.144
Next year is the end of our
vision. Zero goal. No turn on

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:52.348
red is proven to work. Proven to
make streets safer and can be

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:54.515
approved immediately and
implemented in an incremental

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:58.786
manner that prioritizes, for
example, high injury network
intersections, intersections

01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:02.189
with large number of people
walking. Since your last

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.724
meeting, the mayor's disability

01:26:05.528 --> 01:26:08.129
council voted unanimously to
support a citywide no turn on

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.980
red policy, adding to the board

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.701
of supervisors unanimous
approval of a non-binding

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:16.703
resolution sent to you.

01:26:16.772 --> 01:26:18.973
Unfortunately, you and mayor
breed are the only people with

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.174
power and authority who have not

01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:24.111
commented on or voted on

01:26:24.414 --> 01:26:27.480
approving a citywide policy. And
you are the only ones who can

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:29.216
actually make it happen. So I

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:31.419
encourage you to take that up as
soon as possible, ideally before

01:26:32.822 --> 01:26:34.822
the end of the year. Next

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.992
valencia street. Many people,
including you, have talked about

01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:41.630
the evaluation report that is
coming to you shortly.
Unfortunately, something that

01:26:42.132 --> 01:26:44.132
has not been talked about is the

01:26:44.234 --> 01:26:46.435
fact that crash and injury data
will not be included in that

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.870
because sftp and sfpd data is

01:26:50.173 --> 01:26:52.173
lagged and the public doesn't

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.375
know that it that's a problem.

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.612
That's like one of the only
pieces of data that matters,

01:26:56.612 --> 01:26:58.514
right? Is it safe? Our injuries
increased. That's a massive

01:26:59.116 --> 01:27:01.317
problem. I don't know what to do
with that, but someone should

01:27:02.452 --> 01:27:04.452
probably do something about that

01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:06.855
. Staff have also not created a
detailed design for curbside

01:27:07.457 --> 01:27:10.325
protected bike lanes between
15th and 19th, which would mean

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.262
that if you voted to remove the
center bikeway, it would have to

01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:15.296
go back to paint only on

01:27:15.866 --> 01:27:18.100
protected bike lanes. So I would
encourage you to urge staff to

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.269
create a detail design by the
time that evaluation report is

01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:23.710
presented. Finally in the last

01:27:23.206 --> 01:27:25.206
10s, laura taylor was killed on

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:29.812
the I-280 on ramp likely that
happened because there was not

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.480
good signage. She was riding a

01:27:32.616 --> 01:27:34.818
bike on mta streets ended up on
a highway on ramp. Probably

01:27:35.119 --> 01:27:37.860
won't count towards vision zero
numbers. It should. It's a

01:27:37.855 --> 01:27:40.723
really tragic death. Thank you.
Thank you. Any other speakers in

01:27:40.924 --> 01:27:43.920
the room for general public
comment? Seeing none, please

01:27:45.462 --> 01:27:47.462
open the phones. Christine at

01:27:47.531 --> 01:27:49.598
this time, we'll move to remote
public comment not to exceed a

01:27:49.967 --> 01:27:52.680
total time of ten minutes.
Members of the public wishing to

01:27:52.537 --> 01:27:55.238
comment should dial star three
to enter the queue. Each speaker

01:27:55.473 --> 01:27:57.473
will have two minutes for

01:28:00.911 --> 01:28:02.911
speaker. Speaker, you've been

01:28:08.753 --> 01:28:11.588
unmuted. By moderator. Let's go
to the next speaker and come

01:28:17.428 --> 01:28:20.263
back. This is herbert weiner.
One concern I definitely have is

01:28:21.232 --> 01:28:23.232
there should be remote public

01:28:25.237 --> 01:28:27.237
comment. Now sometimes abusive

01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:31.700
language can be used on the
phone. At that point. They

01:28:32.643 --> 01:28:34.643
should. The offensive speaker

01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:37.130
should be cut off and stopped

01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:40.490
from talking. The second concern

01:28:40.484 --> 01:28:43.221
I have is also about the timely
bus service for lowland lincoln

01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:47.390
high schools. I believe this can

01:28:47.626 --> 01:28:49.626
be remedied by adding more

01:28:50.295 --> 01:28:52.295
busses to that run and not

01:28:52.897 --> 01:28:54.897
taking away from other runs. We

01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:57.935
definitely need more busses to
reflect the need for public

01:29:00.605 --> 01:29:03.441
service, and I think that this
is the main key. The leading bus

01:29:06.178 --> 01:29:08.880
stop is not the solution. It's
basically having more busses to

01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:13.450
the fleet. So these are comments

01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:16.719
I have. I realize that you have

01:29:18.123 --> 01:29:20.123
a budgetary crisis. You proclaim

01:29:20.226 --> 01:29:23.161
a budgetary crisis, but I
believe that you still have room

01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:26.930
enough to add more busses to the

01:29:27.766 --> 01:29:29.766
fleet. Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:33.972 --> 01:29:35.972
Next speaker. Hi this is adam in

01:29:36.642 --> 01:29:38.744
soma. Um, first off, thanks for
still keeping public comment.

01:29:39.412 --> 01:29:41.279
It's much appreciated. Not all
of us can get there in person,

01:29:44.116 --> 01:29:46.116
but I wanted to focus on on

01:29:46.619 --> 01:29:48.619
talking about street safety in

01:29:49.688 --> 01:29:51.688
soma because we have a number of

01:29:52.259 --> 01:29:54.259
super narrow alleys here in

01:29:54.761 --> 01:29:56.761
soma, some of which are

01:29:58.331 --> 01:30:00.331
overloaded with two way driving

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.301
as well as parking lanes and if
someone else had commented

01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:05.770
earlier that the sfmta is
deathly afraid of removing

01:30:07.139 --> 01:30:09.139
parking at and that causes

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440
safety issues, we've been trying

01:30:13.446 --> 01:30:15.446
to get sfmta to either remove

01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:18.149
parking and or remove make a two

01:30:19.352 --> 01:30:21.954
lane road one way so that cars
and trucks do not have to go up

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.225
on the sidewalk. But so far
we're going to keep trying. But

01:30:27.995 --> 01:30:29.995
so far your organization has

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:32.630
refused to do either. And one of

01:30:32.733 --> 01:30:34.834
the common comments that we've
gotten from engineers who come

01:30:34.968 --> 01:30:37.770
out is that sfmta does not want
to remove parking spaces because

01:30:39.205 --> 01:30:42.410
drivers will complain about it.
You should not be putting free

01:30:44.578 --> 01:30:47.447
parking above the safety of
residents in a neighborhood who

01:30:48.816 --> 01:30:50.816
walk and bike on local streets.

01:30:52.519 --> 01:30:54.554
You know, cars do not pay for
parking and most of these

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:57.455
streets and you know, everyone

01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:00.726
uses them. The other comment has
to do with the valencia bike

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.999
lane. We know it's not working
the constantly. Just this past

01:31:07.167 --> 01:31:09.167
week yet another semi pickup

01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:11.169
truck is using it as parking

01:31:12.306 --> 01:31:14.306
cars go in and out of the center

01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:17.577
of the bike lane. All the time.
If you're not going to bother

01:31:18.412 --> 01:31:21.181
with enforcement, if you're not
going to bother putting up

01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:25.510
concrete bollards that stop cars
and trucks from coming into the

01:31:26.487 --> 01:31:28.755
bike lane, then rip it out. And
let's go to the protected bike

01:31:29.357 --> 01:31:31.357
lane proposal that luke had

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:34.327
mentioned. We need to put safety
and usability above the

01:31:35.128 --> 01:31:37.128
convenience of car drivers.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Thank you. Thank you. Next

01:31:44.706 --> 01:31:47.574
speaker. Hi there, this is
susanna upton. First, I've long

01:31:48.809 --> 01:31:50.809
awaited to say thank you to all

01:31:52.113 --> 01:31:54.113
of those who advocated for free

01:31:54.683 --> 01:31:56.683
muni for all our youth. Thank

01:31:57.452 --> 01:32:00.387
you. Now we need to get our kids
to school on time. I'm here also

01:32:02.557 --> 01:32:04.557
to talk about the 48. My kid is

01:32:04.626 --> 01:32:06.626
routinely skipped by one, two

01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:11.731
and sometimes 348 busses at 24th
and guerrero and at 24th and

01:32:13.568 --> 01:32:15.568
mission. He routinely is tardy

01:32:16.405 --> 01:32:18.405
for first period and this is a

01:32:18.607 --> 01:32:20.607
really important year for our my

01:32:21.677 --> 01:32:23.677
high schoolers to be on school

01:32:25.947 --> 01:32:27.947
on time. Obviously some when

01:32:29.385 --> 01:32:31.385
he's late we try to get him to

01:32:31.387 --> 01:32:33.387
school by car. Obviously some

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.193
families cannot do this right.
And it contributes to our city

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.360
issues of students being truant.

01:32:42.164 --> 01:32:44.164
I reached out to my school

01:32:44.399 --> 01:32:47.340
community for suggestions, but
instead I heard the same stories

01:32:48.304 --> 01:32:50.304
of kids being skipped in morning

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:54.108
commute on bus lines and see 23,

01:32:56.345 --> 01:32:59.280
28, 29, 44 and seven. I'm here
too. I've I heard the board

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.480
earlier talk about some

01:33:02.117 --> 01:33:04.117
suggestions on rotating start

01:33:04.186 --> 01:33:06.788
times. This is something maybe
to think about, but not

01:33:08.191 --> 01:33:10.859
achievable this year. We need
your help to make improvements

01:33:12.161 --> 01:33:14.161
for our kids. Now for the 48,

01:33:14.497 --> 01:33:16.497
how about an immediate 48

01:33:16.732 --> 01:33:18.732
express? Maybe during morning

01:33:19.268 --> 01:33:21.268
commute 30s one intermission

01:33:23.607 --> 01:33:25.874
stop, maybe mission and 24th and
then no. And all in words right

01:33:27.977 --> 01:33:29.977
now there's a big attendance

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:33.481
issue that the sfusd is working

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:36.350
on. Also bussing are getting our

01:33:36.619 --> 01:33:38.987
kids on bus to school can really
help reduce traffic at our

01:33:40.324 --> 01:33:43.250
school sites and surrounding
streets. Something that rotating

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:47.328
start time would not help with a

01:33:48.432 --> 01:33:50.432
quick comment on the valencia

01:33:51.801 --> 01:33:54.360
corridor is that it? Thank you.
Your time is up a quick okay.

01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:02.210
Okay. Thank you. Next speaker.

01:34:03.914 --> 01:34:05.914
We have no additional speakers.

01:34:05.916 --> 01:34:07.916
Okay. With that, we will close

01:34:08.919 --> 01:34:10.953
public comment and colleagues
and members of public. I

01:34:11.321 --> 01:34:13.622
apologize. We did not have
translation services available.

01:34:14.525 --> 01:34:16.525
Those are we recommend that

01:34:16.627 --> 01:34:18.627
people request that 48 hours in

01:34:19.329 --> 01:34:21.329
advance. There's a phone number

01:34:21.632 --> 01:34:24.333
(415)!A646-4470. Anyone can
request language assistance. We

01:34:25.269 --> 01:34:27.269
request two days in advance so

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.720
we can accommodate that request.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:32.508
With that, please move to item
ten directors that places you on

01:34:33.244 --> 01:34:36.112
item ten your consent calendar.
These items are considered to be

01:34:36.147 --> 01:34:38.147
routine and will be acted upon

01:34:38.683 --> 01:34:41.351
by a single vote unless a member
of the board or public wishes to

01:34:41.519 --> 01:34:43.586
consider an item separately.
Item 10.1 requesting the

01:34:44.355 --> 01:34:46.256
controller to a lot funds and to
draw warrants against such funds

01:34:46.857 --> 01:34:48.857
available or will be available

01:34:49.327 --> 01:34:51.395
in payment of the listed claims
against the sfmta. Those are

01:34:54.532 --> 01:34:57.501
items 10.1 a and b item 10.2
approving various routine
parking and traffic

01:34:57.835 --> 01:34:59.835
modifications and making an

01:34:59.837 --> 01:35:02.380
environmental review findings.
And it's come to my attention

01:35:03.241 --> 01:35:05.842
that item 10.2 a did not include
an address and so will be

01:35:06.879 --> 01:35:08.913
removed and returned to you at a
future meeting. Today you will

01:35:09.715 --> 01:35:11.715
be considering items 10.2 b

01:35:12.817 --> 01:35:15.786
through d as listed in the
agenda item 10.3 authorizing the

01:35:16.654 --> 01:35:18.654

01:35:18.823 --> 01:35:21.191
their designee to execute a
grant agreement in any

01:35:21.225 --> 01:35:23.293
amendments to such grant
agreement with the california

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:27.230
department of transportation in

01:35:27.499 --> 01:35:29.533
to receive approximately $1.3
million in discretionary funding

01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:33.690
for the sfmta's embarcadero

01:35:33.905 --> 01:35:36.730
mobility resilience plan. Item
10.4 author rising, the director

01:35:36.341 --> 01:35:38.709

Consistent with the sf board of

01:36:38.538 --> 01:36:40.538
directors recommendation given

01:36:40.607 --> 01:36:43.442
at the OCTOBER 17th, 2023 board
meeting, the application from

01:36:43.443 --> 01:36:45.477
the hays valley merchants
council for roadway shared

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.800

environmental review findings.
That concludes your consent

01:37:01.394 --> 01:37:04.129
calendar. Okay, colleagues,
unless there are clarifying

01:37:04.197 --> 01:37:07.990
questions, I'd like to go to
public comment on the consent

01:37:17.911 --> 01:37:19.911
calendar for anyone in the room.

01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:24.490
I had a couple, but the hays

01:37:24.751 --> 01:37:26.751
street. I don't know what to

01:37:26.754 --> 01:37:28.754
say. Other than I think that it

01:37:30.124 --> 01:37:32.124
should be closed 24 over seven

01:37:32.492 --> 01:37:34.492
365 and so the merchants meager

01:37:34.662 --> 01:37:36.662
ask to have all weekend long

01:37:37.765 --> 01:37:39.765
should be granted and stripping

01:37:40.234 --> 01:37:42.234
it down further is just it's

01:37:44.238 --> 01:37:46.673
silly and it echoes it's much
like valencia and many other

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.875
merchant corridors we need to do

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.813
things for our city that help
our merchants and bringing in

01:37:57.251 --> 01:37:59.552
cars just doesn't and then I was
really curious about the

01:38:00.754 --> 01:38:03.424
embarcadero money. The report
made it sound like, hey, we are

01:38:04.258 --> 01:38:06.493
getting free money and unless we
have money coming from somewhere

01:38:07.228 --> 01:38:10.163
else, I'd really like to hear
more about what the money is

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:14.335
going to be used for. I mean, I
don't want to turn down free

01:38:14.335 --> 01:38:16.335
money, but I care very much

01:38:16.837 --> 01:38:18.872
about the embarcadero and think
that that's another place that

01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:21.542
should not have cars. And so I'd
like to know what the money will

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:25.946
be spent on and that it will be
about planning what's best for

01:38:27.482 --> 01:38:30.450
the embarcadero and yeah, I
can't remember, but thank you.

01:38:30.518 --> 01:38:32.518
Thanks for your comments. Next

01:38:37.626 --> 01:38:40.610
speaker, please. Good afternoon.
Alan barradell here. I want to

01:38:41.263 --> 01:38:44.198
express my opposition to any
plan to close hays street for

01:38:46.568 --> 01:38:49.436
more than one day a week. A one
day a week closure was already

01:38:50.672 --> 01:38:52.672
it was already extensively

01:38:52.974 --> 01:38:54.974
discussed and already agreed

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.140
upon. In fact, one day per week
was the recommendation of sfmta

01:39:02.518 --> 01:39:04.518
staff. It should be clear why

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:07.421
something about the process,
something about the process

01:39:08.724 --> 01:39:11.258
seems unfair. There should be a
fair process for sfmta

01:39:12.294 --> 01:39:14.230
initiatives and policies that
can negatively impact a

01:39:14.563 --> 01:39:17.165
neighborhood, and especially the
small businesses and the

01:39:18.467 --> 01:39:21.135
residents there. And I'm
dumbfounded by what appears to

01:39:22.404 --> 01:39:24.404
be sfmta's tone deaf steamroll

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.974
ing over residents and merchants
concerning concerns regarding

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.760
hayes valley street closures as

01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:34.820
it reneges on earlier agreements
. I support hays street

01:39:34.483 --> 01:39:36.483
residents and merchants in

01:39:36.586 --> 01:39:39.200
stopping the sfmta and
supervisor preston from

01:39:40.322 --> 01:39:42.322
reneging, reneging on this

01:39:46.228 --> 01:39:48.964
agreement. For a limited said
the agreement was for a limited

01:39:50.133 --> 01:39:53.101
hayes street closure and trying
to replace it with an unnest

01:39:54.504 --> 01:39:57.472
necessary and unwanted multi day
closure or even worse, a

01:39:58.174 --> 01:40:00.174
permanent 24 over seven street

01:40:00.776 --> 01:40:03.712
closure. I urge the sfmta board
here that it must approve the

01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:06.682
original single day programing
that was agreed upon based on

01:40:07.784 --> 01:40:10.686
studies reviewed and
recommendations by the sfmta and

01:40:11.988 --> 01:40:13.988
outreach to hays street

01:40:14.324 --> 01:40:16.324
merchants at that time. Please

01:40:16.726 --> 01:40:18.726
note hayes valley does not lack

01:40:19.929 --> 01:40:22.433
open space. It's got a lot of
parks. We support traffic and

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:24.433
transportation plans for all

01:40:26.403 --> 01:40:28.403
modes, all modes and with

01:40:28.405 --> 01:40:30.506
unobstructed access to hayes
street business corridor for a

01:40:31.875 --> 01:40:33.875
vibrant, accessible, a healthier

01:40:35.879 --> 01:40:37.879
business. So thank you. Thank

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:45.287
you. Next speaker, please. Good

01:40:45.556 --> 01:40:47.690
afternoon. Directors director
tomlin. My name is david

01:40:48.392 --> 01:40:51.194
robinson. I'm a homeowner in
hayes valley and also a member

01:40:51.194 --> 01:40:53.295
of the board of directors for
the hayes valley neighborhood

01:40:54.998 --> 01:40:56.998
association, an obviously I am

01:40:58.536 --> 01:41:00.536
here in support of the friday

01:41:00.738 --> 01:41:03.673
night, saturday closure
continuance of the closure of

01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:06.241
hayes street and the corridor

01:41:07.611 --> 01:41:10.579
between golf and octavia. Also
supporting that staff look into

01:41:11.448 --> 01:41:13.448
full time closure of hayes

01:41:13.517 --> 01:41:15.517
street the restaurants and the

01:41:15.587 --> 01:41:17.587
shops along that corridor are

01:41:19.290 --> 01:41:21.391
benefit greatly. We represent
residents of hayes valley that

01:41:21.759 --> 01:41:23.759
have overwhelmingly supported

01:41:24.762 --> 01:41:26.762
continuing this. I think the

01:41:27.498 --> 01:41:29.498
board was received many emails

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.636
in support of it and they have
overwhelmingly overwhelmingly

01:41:34.339 --> 01:41:36.339
commented that that makes our

01:41:37.575 --> 01:41:39.575
neighborhood even safer. And

01:41:39.711 --> 01:41:42.379
more well used. And it is a
destination not only for

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.380
residents, for people from

01:41:45.416 --> 01:41:47.517
throughout the city, if not from
throughout the state that visit

01:41:47.952 --> 01:41:49.952
san francisco. They've made that

01:41:50.188 --> 01:41:53.900
very clear. So I urge you to
support that. And then on down

01:41:54.393 --> 01:41:56.393
the road have staff look at

01:41:56.661 --> 01:41:59.596
continuing that on a 24/7 basis.
Thank you for your time. Thank

01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:07.770
you. Next speaker, please. Good

01:42:07.906 --> 01:42:09.906
afternoon. Board members and

01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:12.677
director tumlin. My name is
robin leavitt. I'm a 30 year

01:42:13.778 --> 01:42:15.778
resident of hayes valley and I'm

01:42:17.449 --> 01:42:19.449
here to speak in support of item

01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:22.753
10.5. The recommendation for
hayes street shared spaces on

01:42:25.591 --> 01:42:28.426
fridays and saturdays, but also
directs your staff to design a

01:42:29.328 --> 01:42:31.328
process to pedestrianize a

01:42:31.964 --> 01:42:33.964
street. Since receiving sfmta

01:42:35.534 --> 01:42:37.435
staff feedback at the OCTOBER
17th board meeting, the

01:42:38.103 --> 01:42:40.872
community has committed to
making the hayes street shared

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.770
space a viable program with five
activation events and eight more

01:42:47.647 --> 01:42:49.848
scheduled by the end of the
year. The opening of streets to

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.284
pedestrians and users other than
motorized vehicles is consistent

01:42:55.754 --> 01:42:57.754
with san francisco's transit

01:42:58.323 --> 01:43:00.323
first climate action and vision

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:03.295
zero goals as well as the
recommendations outlined in the

01:43:04.697 --> 01:43:06.697
market. Octavia area plan, which

01:43:08.601 --> 01:43:10.735
the city adopted in 2008. For
over three years, repurposed

01:43:12.371 --> 01:43:14.973
hayes street has been a boon for
hayes valley residents, visitors

01:43:16.576 --> 01:43:18.576
and merchants alike, providing

01:43:18.812 --> 01:43:20.914
an oasis of calm and safety in a
neighborhood with some of the

01:43:22.116 --> 01:43:24.116
worst air pollution levels in

01:43:24.484 --> 01:43:26.484
the city and inundated with

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.688
traffic clogged arterial
streets, including oak fauci,

01:43:30.857 --> 01:43:32.857
franklin golf and octavia

01:43:33.259 --> 01:43:35.259
boulevard. For fairness dictates

01:43:35.762 --> 01:43:38.164
that if our streets are going to
be to continue to serve as

01:43:39.899 --> 01:43:42.335
traffic sewers in exchange the
community deserves traffic free

01:43:43.102 --> 01:43:45.102
space as a respite from

01:43:45.105 --> 01:43:47.105
pollution noise and the

01:43:47.974 --> 01:43:50.409
perpetual threat of being hit by
motor vehicles. Please, please

01:43:51.212 --> 01:43:53.212
approve the friday and saturday

01:43:55.150 --> 01:43:57.884
schedule and direct sfmta staff
to design a process to

01:43:58.986 --> 01:44:00.986
pedestrianize a street giving

01:44:02.890 --> 01:44:04.890
our community a path to a 24

01:44:04.524 --> 01:44:06.524
over seven on hayes street.

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:08.860
shared space. Thank you very

01:44:08.896 --> 01:44:10.896
much for your consideration.

01:44:12.633 --> 01:44:14.633
Thank you. Next speaker, please.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.300
Hi my name is andrew steiner.

01:44:18.205 --> 01:44:20.205
I'm here to ask to please

01:44:21.575 --> 01:44:23.776
approve item 10.5 to continue
with the program on friday and

01:44:24.411 --> 01:44:26.345
saturday for the hayes street
shared spaces and also instruct

01:44:27.849 --> 01:44:29.783
mta staff to design a process to
pedestrianize a street. I

01:44:30.852 --> 01:44:32.852
created a website called car

01:44:33.755 --> 01:44:35.755
freezorg. We've gotten over 1300

01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:37.790
signatures on it so far. We've

01:44:39.527 --> 01:44:42.461
also gotten the endorsement of
the hayes valley neighborhood
association, hayes valley for

01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:46.166
all the lower haight merchants
and neighbors association on

01:44:47.168 --> 01:44:49.168
page slow street, the outer

01:44:49.637 --> 01:44:51.938
sunset neighbors. And yesterday
we got an endorsement from the

01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:54.541
sf symphony. This is a broad
coalition of merchants,

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.430
neighbors and organizations that

01:44:57.178 --> 01:44:59.879
all support a fully
pedestrianized hayes street. All

01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:03.149
we're asking for today are those

01:45:03.184 --> 01:45:05.184
two particular days. The

01:45:05.687 --> 01:45:08.556
feedback from sfmta staff at the
last meeting was to activate the

01:45:09.124 --> 01:45:11.692
space more. As someone else said
, we've already scheduled 13

01:45:13.661 --> 01:45:15.661
events between then and the end

01:45:15.797 --> 01:45:17.798
of the year when I say we, I'm
not doing all of this. These are

01:45:18.166 --> 01:45:20.401
independent orgs that are using
the space for the next five

01:45:21.336 --> 01:45:24.138
fridays are already booked for
events. So I just want to point

01:45:24.973 --> 01:45:27.608
out how important that evening
is for us. It's our busiest

01:45:29.711 --> 01:45:31.545
evening and I really want to
thank you all for the discussion

01:45:32.647 --> 01:45:35.182
you had three weeks ago to
amending it to allow us to

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.180
continue to use friday. So thank

01:45:38.554 --> 01:45:40.554
you for all your work. Cheers

01:45:45.627 --> 01:45:47.627
thank you. Next speaker, please.

01:45:48.297 --> 01:45:50.598
Hi, my name is richard johnson
and I'm with a group called be

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
safe. And then also we have an

01:45:54.404 --> 01:45:57.339
ongoing petition, citywide
petition, and that's the

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.244
petition fair. Hayes valley and
I'm here to bring up another

01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:05.450
point of where it's interesting

01:46:05.214 --> 01:46:08.160
that many of my neighbors and
friends are focusing on hayes

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.855
street. We have a car free
street that's been there since

01:46:13.857 --> 01:46:15.991
the late 60s. It's called the
buchanan mall. And I think if

01:46:16.659 --> 01:46:19.594
you're going to expand energy
that would be something to be

01:46:20.129 --> 01:46:22.129
looking at. It's already car

01:46:23.699 --> 01:46:26.135
free. It would actually do what
the merchants are saying along

01:46:27.570 --> 01:46:29.570
hayes street to activate the

01:46:31.608 --> 01:46:33.709
lower fillmore and the fillmore
district in general. But it's

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.100
been something that's been there

01:46:36.145 --> 01:46:38.145
since the 70s. I have to say, as

01:46:38.414 --> 01:46:40.414
someone who's a transit rider

01:46:40.483 --> 01:46:43.218
and a pedestrian, I reach out to
you as the agency to really make

01:46:44.353 --> 01:46:46.353
our neighborhood instead of

01:46:46.723 --> 01:46:49.292
closing our streets, doing more
with the transit. I'm a regular

01:46:50.727 --> 01:46:52.727
rider on the haight haight

01:46:52.963 --> 01:46:54.963
street busses and to me it was

01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:57.980
like the usual waiting to go to

01:46:57.667 --> 01:47:00.602
an appointment at ucsf and had
to wait like 30 minutes for a

01:47:02.672 --> 01:47:05.642
bus. And we were promised
greater transit with all the

01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:08.845
development that that's come to
our neighborhood. And we're not

01:47:10.314 --> 01:47:12.314
seeing that. So I'm saying that

01:47:13.984 --> 01:47:15.984
you should follow the what your

01:47:16.153 --> 01:47:18.921
staff had recommended and to
scale it back with certain

01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:23.893
conditions and add not to go
forward with the two day and

01:47:24.261 --> 01:47:26.261
definitely not to move forward

01:47:27.765 --> 01:47:29.765
with studies to close off the

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:32.100
street. You should actually be

01:47:32.403 --> 01:47:35.271
expanding your energy and kind
of teaming with the money that's
already been invested on the

01:47:38.108 --> 01:47:40.944
buchanan mall to really that to
me could achieve everything that

01:47:42.447 --> 01:47:45.181
everyone is asking. And it would
be a simple walk for people to

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:49.119
just walk over there and to do
something which I do on a

01:47:51.288 --> 01:47:53.990
regular basis. I want to thank
you for your time and like I

01:47:54.758 --> 01:47:57.494
say, I encourage you to follow
your staff report. Thank you,
director thomas speaker, please.

01:47:58.263 --> 01:48:00.263
Okay. Thank you. That's your

01:48:04.969 --> 01:48:07.671
time. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm
jennifer laska, the PRESIDENT Of

01:48:07.772 --> 01:48:10.674
the hayes valley neighborhood
association. And I'm also here

01:48:10.675 --> 01:48:12.675
on behalf of lloyd silverstein,

01:48:12.877 --> 01:48:14.979
who couldn't be here, who's
PRESIDENT Of the hayes valley

01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:19.116
merchants council, just to urge
you to vote yes on the consent

01:48:20.352 --> 01:48:23.320
agenda item today for hayes
street. I think we had a robust

01:48:24.756 --> 01:48:27.524
conversation last month and came
to a good compromise. So please

01:48:30.261 --> 01:48:32.261
just stick with it and hope you

01:48:32.364 --> 01:48:34.532
vote yes. Thank you. Thank you
for your comment. Any other

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.500
speakers in the room seeing

01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:40.400
none. Please open the remote at
this time. We'll move to remote

01:48:41.506 --> 01:48:43.674
public comment not to exceed a
total time of ten minutes.

01:48:43.942 --> 01:48:46.100
Members of the public wishing to
comment should dial star three

01:48:46.744 --> 01:48:48.744
to enter the queue. Each speaker

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:50.814
will have two minutes. Moderator

01:48:51.417 --> 01:48:53.151
first speaker hi, good afternoon
. This is barry toronto. For

01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:56.787
some reason my hand was lowered
during public comment and I

01:48:57.389 --> 01:48:59.991
didn't get a chance to make
public comments. So, so thank

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.260
you for taking that away from

01:49:03.895 --> 01:49:05.895
me. Just like you take it away.

01:49:06.566 --> 01:49:08.566
My taxi stands in the city as

01:49:08.734 --> 01:49:11.269
well by not having enforcement,
you could really make more money

01:49:12.204 --> 01:49:15.390
for transit if you actually
actually had more pco's on

01:49:18.110 --> 01:49:21.790
during the off hours and forcing
the illegal double parking and

01:49:21.213 --> 01:49:23.213
the illegal parking that goes on

01:49:23.215 --> 01:49:25.284
in the streets. I want to
address this regarding hayes

01:49:27.787 --> 01:49:29.787
valley. Obviously, the closure

01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:32.890
doesn't work for every business.

01:49:33.893 --> 01:49:35.893
And even though man leaving

01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:38.195
represented small business,

01:49:38.264 --> 01:49:40.264
there's some some hypocrisy

01:49:40.399 --> 01:49:43.168
going on here. If you care about
small business, then you should

01:49:43.937 --> 01:49:46.710
you should do better outreach
and hear the concerns of the

01:49:46.172 --> 01:49:48.172
small business people that don't

01:49:49.275 --> 01:49:51.275
benefit from certain changes,

01:49:51.678 --> 01:49:53.678
such as somebody put a the

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.581
rental bikes in the middle of
the block, taking away this this

01:50:01.621 --> 01:50:04.523
businesses. Deliveries so he
didn't have a place for the

01:50:04.724 --> 01:50:06.724
delivery to double park in the

01:50:07.594 --> 01:50:09.594
bike lane so the thing is that

01:50:11.297 --> 01:50:13.999
you you can't take care of
everybody's needs but you need

01:50:14.234 --> 01:50:17.103
to listen to all members of the
community, not just a few,

01:50:17.571 --> 01:50:20.720
because then they become
unintended consequences. Thank

01:50:20.741 --> 01:50:22.741
you very much. Thank you. Next

01:50:31.651 --> 01:50:33.651
speaker. Hi this is adam from

01:50:33.754 --> 01:50:36.524
d6. I just wanted to call in
support of all of the hayes

01:50:36.524 --> 01:50:38.524
valley residents who are

01:50:39.626 --> 01:50:41.626
supporting the closure of hayes

01:50:43.397 --> 01:50:45.664
street. I know here in some we
would love to do similar with

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.369
some of our streets. So it's the
kind of thing that makes a

01:50:49.369 --> 01:50:51.369
neighborhood more viable, more

01:50:51.606 --> 01:50:54.700
popular. And it's great to have
walkable, walkable streets and

01:50:54.942 --> 01:50:57.811
walkable areas with restaurants
and businesses. San francisco

01:50:58.713 --> 01:51:00.713
should see more of this across

01:51:00.948 --> 01:51:03.349
the city. So I encourage you,
please do what the residents and

01:51:04.318 --> 01:51:07.220
majority of business owners on
hayes are asking and close the

01:51:09.724 --> 01:51:11.724
street as requested. Thank you.

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.640
thank you. Next speaker. Okay,

01:51:20.801 --> 01:51:23.503
this is susanna upton. We need
more pedestrian space. So

01:51:24.505 --> 01:51:27.408
pedestrianization of hayes seems
right to me. I have more

01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:31.745
experience on valencia, which
really needs increased

01:51:34.649 --> 01:51:36.649
pedestrian pathways. If hayes is

01:51:37.285 --> 01:51:39.285
like valencia where I have to

01:51:39.887 --> 01:51:41.887
walk in a single file, single

01:51:41.989 --> 01:51:43.989
file with my walking partner,

01:51:46.295 --> 01:51:48.429
that's just not right. We can't
we can't look into windows

01:51:50.399 --> 01:51:52.399
together where we it's difficult

01:51:54.402 --> 01:51:56.402
to have a conversation in my by

01:51:56.571 --> 01:51:58.571
my senior mother in law is feels

01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:02.341
rushed and pushed along on

01:52:03.379 --> 01:52:05.613
valencia I just might be the
case for hayes as well and so

01:52:06.382 --> 01:52:08.382
more pedestrian ization in our

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.200
city is welcomed by me. Thank

01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:18.325
you. Thank you. We have no
additional callers. Okay thank

01:52:18.494 --> 01:52:20.495
you. We'll close public comment
on the consent calendar.

01:52:21.230 --> 01:52:23.230
Colleagues, MAY I have a motion

01:52:26.668 --> 01:52:28.770
to move the items? Second,
second. Thank you. Please call

01:52:30.205 --> 01:52:32.607
the roll on the motion to
approve the consent calendar.
Director heminger heminger.

01:52:33.375 --> 01:52:35.375
Director henderson. Henderson. I

01:52:36.813 --> 01:52:38.813
director hinsey. I I. Director.

01:52:39.382 --> 01:52:41.917
So I. So I chair eken. Eken. I
thank you. The consent calendar

01:52:42.185 --> 01:52:45.860
is approved. Thank you. Let's
move on to the regular calendar.

01:52:46.155 --> 01:52:48.156
Please call item 11. Item 11
authorizing the director of

01:52:48.824 --> 01:52:51.125
transportation to issue a
request for proposals for

01:52:52.661 --> 01:52:54.661
contract number sf mta 202420

01:52:54.864 --> 01:52:56.864
fta for consulting services

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.901
supporting the communications
based train control upgrade

01:52:59.569 --> 01:53:01.569
project for initial term of five

01:53:02.338 --> 01:53:04.339
years in an amount not to exceed
$25 million, with five options

01:53:04.974 --> 01:53:06.974
to extend the term for an

01:53:07.744 --> 01:53:09.878
additional year for a total of
ten years in an amount not to

01:53:10.546 --> 01:53:13.416
exceed $36 million. Good
afternoon, directors. I'm dan

01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.218
howard. I'm the project manager
for the train control upgrade

01:53:19.889 --> 01:53:21.889
project at. Today. We're going

01:53:22.859 --> 01:53:25.662
to give you you decide to give
the opportunity to give you a

01:53:25.662 --> 01:53:28.330
little bit of a project update
in addition to requesting your

01:53:30.534 --> 01:53:32.534
permission to issue the rfp for

01:53:33.504 --> 01:53:36.339
our project consultants. So
we'll go through a little bit of

01:53:36.473 --> 01:53:38.473
the background as well as the

01:53:38.475 --> 01:53:40.420
project objectives and the
progress report. We'll talk

01:53:40.810 --> 01:53:43.120
about our approach for risk and
then go into the contracting

01:53:43.646 --> 01:53:45.646
strategy of which this

01:53:48.319 --> 01:53:50.319
consultant rfp is a part. So why

01:53:50.487 --> 01:53:52.922
are we upgrading the train
control system for our muni

01:53:54.258 --> 01:53:56.258
rail, our train control system

01:53:56.293 --> 01:53:58.394
is approaching 30 years old and
it has not been comprehensively

01:54:01.231 --> 01:54:03.299
overhauled during its life. Some
core components are still the

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:08.939
original components from 1994
1998, and in some cases the

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400
system supplier has given us

01:54:11.575 --> 01:54:14.430
notice. As for some of the parts
that they're obsolete, no longer

01:54:14.178 --> 01:54:16.178
manufactured and no longer

01:54:16.713 --> 01:54:18.914
supported. Up on the screen you
see the floppy disks that we

01:54:19.917 --> 01:54:22.619
boot the computer up each
morning with. Those are the

01:54:23.855 --> 01:54:25.855
actual floppy disks. Is the

01:54:26.757 --> 01:54:28.725
state of the art now. And the
train control industry has

01:54:29.793 --> 01:54:31.793
passed us by by several

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:33.964
generations. But because we
haven't meaningfully upgraded

01:54:34.165 --> 01:54:36.933
the system, this actually
presents a unique opportunity to

01:54:36.934 --> 01:54:38.934
reconsider our train control

01:54:39.304 --> 01:54:41.304
needs and to host an open bid

01:54:43.975 --> 01:54:46.643
for the replacement model train
control systems. Today they

01:54:47.311 --> 01:54:49.311
track all of the train locations

01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.715
. They prevent collisions and
they manage the spacing between

01:54:52.517 --> 01:54:54.517
trains as well as headways in

01:54:55.386 --> 01:54:58.322
the tunnel. They automatically
operate the trains by
controlling the accelerator and

01:54:59.157 --> 01:55:01.792
braking. They set the train's
routing in the system by

01:55:02.861 --> 01:55:04.861
distinguishing between a j and a

01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:07.290
k and l or an m because of those

01:55:08.266 --> 01:55:10.734
functions. As the train control
system has outsized influence on

01:55:12.203 --> 01:55:15.139
our service delivery, the train
control system can help us

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:18.876
ensure consistent travel times
and frequencies. It can also

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.120
allow muni to offer flexible

01:55:22.147 --> 01:55:24.147
service plans and better rider

01:55:24.349 --> 01:55:26.350
communication during special
events and service disruptions

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.724
such as apec. This we can also
reduce some types of delays that

01:55:31.724 --> 01:55:34.359
are caused by train congestion
or traffic signal delays or

01:55:40.766 --> 01:55:43.468
junction delays. As I mentioned,
our current system is aging. It

01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:47.400
has outdated hardware and
software that's increasingly

01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:49.390
obsolete and difficult to

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:52.577
maintain on due to the lack of
parts. And as our maintainers

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:55.613
retire, it's we're also losing

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:59.317
experience both on the on the
supplier side as well as the

01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:03.354
sfmta side. The system is also
dependent on 1980s technology

01:56:04.356 --> 01:56:06.356
that is fragile and easily

01:56:06.426 --> 01:56:08.426
disturbed, which complicates our

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:10.561
efforts to modernize and to

01:56:12.431 --> 01:56:14.432
upgrade unrelated aspects like
the special trackwork, for

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:19.638
example. So oftentimes in
service we have trains that fail

01:56:20.706 --> 01:56:23.575
to connect to the atcs and they
have to operate without it. When

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.680
that happens, that causes gaps.
Bunching slowdowns and rolling

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.348
congestion throughout the

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:33.419
system. The 2019 muni
reliability working group, which

01:56:34.254 --> 01:56:36.254
was a panel of mta board members

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:39.524
, supervisors, advocates, labor
and transit experts, recommended

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:42.226
that we replace the atcs in as

01:56:42.896 --> 01:56:44.896
as a top priority for muni in

01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:48.467
additional a there is no train
control on the surface. On the

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:51.504
surface, trains are unregulated
and therefore our junctions are

01:56:52.706 --> 01:56:55.730
first come, first serve and the
traffic signals that are meant

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:59.120
to work with those junctions
have limited ability to

01:56:59.446 --> 01:57:01.446
coordinate because they cannot

01:57:03.284 --> 01:57:06.520
see the trains coming in advance
. So we're working against the

01:57:06.286 --> 01:57:08.286
clock where we don't know the

01:57:08.889 --> 01:57:11.190
end of the countdown. Two weeks
ago, the system experienced a

01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:14.160
complete failure of the central
components. In the morning of

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:16.227
OCTOBER 24th, trains were

01:57:16.497 --> 01:57:19.320
stopped in the tunnel for nearly
half an hour. As time passes, it

01:57:20.201 --> 01:57:22.202
will likely it will become more
likely that we'll experience

01:57:22.536 --> 01:57:24.904
failures such as this that will
affect service. And without

01:57:25.539 --> 01:57:27.539
spare parts we run the risk of

01:57:28.942 --> 01:57:31.100
even greater disruption. The
agency is working behind the

01:57:32.246 --> 01:57:34.246
scenes to refurbish our own

01:57:34.315 --> 01:57:36.616
spares, salvage what we can
obtain used equipment from

01:57:37.518 --> 01:57:40.120
sister systems. But when we're
doing that, we're borrowing

01:57:40.588 --> 01:57:42.588
time. We'll need to replace the

01:57:45.259 --> 01:57:47.259
in about the next 5 to 8 years

01:57:47.761 --> 01:57:50.630
upgrading and upgrade and
modernizing the current train
control system to current

01:57:51.632 --> 01:57:53.701
technology will itself provide
benefits just by adding the

01:57:56.789 --> 01:57:59.373
modern technological
capabilities such as wi-fi that
we all are familiar with to

01:57:59.774 --> 01:58:01.774
improve metro performance and

01:58:02.276 --> 01:58:04.311
reliability. On top of that, we
are also planning to expand

01:58:04.712 --> 01:58:06.712
train control to the surface

01:58:06.714 --> 01:58:09.684
where it doesn't presently exist
to allow us to have
comprehensive rail service

01:58:10.685 --> 01:58:12.920
management and to compensate for
some of the drawbacks on the

01:58:13.588 --> 01:58:15.656
geometric layout of our city's
railway. We can't completely

01:58:16.691 --> 01:58:19.226
overcome the limitations that
we've inherited from our

01:58:20.195 --> 01:58:23.130
streetcar system. But kbtc can
significantly address the delays

01:58:23.364 --> 01:58:25.364
that are caused by signaling and

01:58:25.468 --> 01:58:27.335
congestion and kbtc is a strong
investment in the reliability

01:58:28.837 --> 01:58:30.837
and capacity of our muni rail

01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:36.277
service. So after the need, I'm
going to go into the project,

01:58:37.279 --> 01:58:40.247
the train control project that I
manage is a ten year project to

01:58:42.116 --> 01:58:45.530
update the atcs to a modern kbtc
and to expand the oversight of

01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:48.210
kbtc to the surface portion of

01:58:49.625 --> 01:58:51.625
the rail network. These are the

01:58:52.861 --> 01:58:54.896
key objectives for the project.
The project will increase our

01:58:55.697 --> 01:58:58.165
system capacity of muni,
allowing us to run more frequent

01:58:59.801 --> 01:59:01.801
service. It will also extend

01:59:02.573 --> 01:59:05.507
upon the exemplary safety record
of our current atcs and actually

01:59:06.309 --> 01:59:09.144
extend those safety benefits.
This system wide as opposed to

01:59:10.179 --> 01:59:12.179
just the subway. It will allow

01:59:12.481 --> 01:59:15.316
us to have more consistent train
spacing and travel times. It

01:59:17.553 --> 01:59:19.255
will support our service at all
times. It will allow us

01:59:20.456 --> 01:59:22.456
flexibility for special events

01:59:22.492 --> 01:59:24.593
and contingency operations ins.
And we're also taking the

01:59:25.495 --> 01:59:27.629
opportunity to build in with
with the supplier contract,

01:59:28.597 --> 01:59:30.597
continual system upgrades on

01:59:30.666 --> 01:59:33.468
hardware and software so that we
don't find ourselves in a

01:59:33.803 --> 01:59:35.803
position where we have a 30 year

01:59:36.506 --> 01:59:39.241
old system. Again in these are
some of the benefits that we

01:59:40.944 --> 01:59:43.212
expect to deliver to riders once
the project is done. Transit

01:59:43.813 --> 01:59:46.514
riders can expect to have fewer
delays after the project has

01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:50.485
been delivered. They can expect
to have faster trips and less

01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:53.622
time waiting between trains.
They can also expect to have

01:59:54.357 --> 01:59:56.792
more consistent wait times that
match the advertised frequency

01:59:57.794 --> 01:59:59.794
as opposed to frustrating

01:59:59.930 --> 02:00:02.898
bunching and gaps. They can also
expect not to be stuck between

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.568
stations in the in the tunnel,
as was the case in 2018 and

02:00:08.671 --> 02:00:10.671
2019. And they also will allow

02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:13.142
our our transportation
management center to have more

02:00:13.777 --> 02:00:15.777
flexibility in managing service

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.460
out in the outer reaches of the

02:00:20.851 --> 02:00:22.952
system. So the train control
project will be delivered in

02:00:23.954 --> 02:00:25.954
phases, starting with the pilot

02:00:26.223 --> 02:00:28.925
phase. That will be a limited
street running area that will

02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:31.260
validate the complete street

02:00:32.630 --> 02:00:34.997
kbtc system. This is this is
proposed on an area of track

02:00:36.133 --> 02:00:38.868
that is both critical to our
service with the to the ballpark

02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:41.604
and the chase center. But it's
also an area where we don't

02:00:41.705 --> 02:00:44.173
presently have train control. So
it represents a lower risk in

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.800
terms of failures. If there is a

02:00:47.278 --> 02:00:50.800
failure on the pilot phase, we
would simply revert back to the

02:00:50.681 --> 02:00:52.681
operating rules that we have

02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:55.180
today. Once we've successfully
demonstrated the system is

02:00:56.587 --> 02:00:59.555
capable from the equipment on
the vehicles to the equipment on

02:00:59.623 --> 02:01:01.623
the wayside to the central

02:01:02.626 --> 02:01:04.461
equipment, will then take on the
most technically complex part of

02:01:05.564 --> 02:01:07.564
the project, which is replacing

02:01:07.632 --> 02:01:09.933
the existing atcs with the new
system in the market, street and

02:01:11.502 --> 02:01:13.502
central subways concurrent to

02:01:13.504 --> 02:01:16.373
that will be also beginning to
do the planning and design and

02:01:19.977 --> 02:01:21.977
implementation for the exterior

02:01:23.348 --> 02:01:25.348
lines such as the nlcm and t and

02:01:28.753 --> 02:01:30.753
j. To give you a little schedule

02:01:30.789 --> 02:01:33.557
update right now, we're
currently working through the

02:01:33.557 --> 02:01:35.557
vendor selection and contracting

02:01:35.559 --> 02:01:37.559
process. So in JANUARY you

02:01:38.997 --> 02:01:41.666
authorize us to issue an rfp and
to select a supplier for the

02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:44.801
kbtc system. We issued the rfp

02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:47.505
in MARCH and we received
proposals after several

02:01:47.506 --> 02:01:49.907
extension requests from the
suppliers. We did finally

02:01:50.441 --> 02:01:52.441
receive proposals on OCTOBER

02:01:52.944 --> 02:01:55.813
10th. Currently we have those
proposals in hand and we are

02:01:56.749 --> 02:01:59.651
evaluate eating the bids going
forward. We expect to bring a

02:02:00.185 --> 02:02:02.185
contract to you for the train

02:02:02.454 --> 02:02:05.189
control supplier in the summer
and we'll also plan. We also

02:02:06.525 --> 02:02:08.593
plan to bring the contract for
this consultant that you're

02:02:09.661 --> 02:02:11.395
considering on this item today.
Around the same time, so that

02:02:12.798 --> 02:02:15.300
we'll take them both to the
board together following your

02:02:15.368 --> 02:02:17.869
approval, we'll need the board
of supervisors approval for both

02:02:18.337 --> 02:02:20.337
contracts. And so we anticipate

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.240
a notice to proceed for the

02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:26.900
train control supplier in early

02:02:26.912 --> 02:02:29.547
2025, which is what you see on
the screen there. Following the

02:02:29.681 --> 02:02:31.681
ncp. We expect an 18 month

02:02:31.751 --> 02:02:34.519
design period, followed by the
beginning of the pilot phase. We

02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:38.220
expect to deliver the first

02:02:38.257 --> 02:02:40.257
pilot segment and have it be

02:02:40.426 --> 02:02:42.426
operational in 2028 and then to

02:02:43.429 --> 02:02:45.429
turn over the subway to kbtc

02:02:46.499 --> 02:02:48.600
permanently in 2030, we
expansion to the surface will

02:02:49.636 --> 02:02:51.937
also, on the surface lines will
take place concurrent. Lee so

02:02:52.472 --> 02:02:55.307
we'll be able to deliver those a
little bit faster with the last

02:02:56.342 --> 02:02:59.110
one finishing in 2032. And then
after we finished all the

02:02:59.478 --> 02:03:02.800
deployment, the contract that
you authorize us to, to

02:03:04.784 --> 02:03:07.386
advertise for includes up to 20
years of support for the ctc

02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:14.580
from the supplier. Our funding

02:03:14.427 --> 02:03:16.427
approach, which is inextricably

02:03:16.596 --> 02:03:19.531
linked to uncertainty. And at
this point of the project we are

02:03:21.101 --> 02:03:23.168
in the most the highest period
of uncertainty. Given that the

02:03:25.639 --> 02:03:27.639
bids are out and we don't yet

02:03:27.708 --> 02:03:30.443
have an understanding of what
the impact of those of the

02:03:31.511 --> 02:03:33.511
contract values MAY be, we are

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.800
going taking the project through

02:03:36.183 --> 02:03:39.840
the process and we should have a
much better picture for when we

02:03:40.210 --> 02:03:42.210
when the board is updated on the

02:03:42.757 --> 02:03:44.757
budget and the cip next year.

02:03:44.992 --> 02:03:46.992
But right now in our current

02:03:47.895 --> 02:03:49.895
cap, we're funded at 290 million

02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.930
in this cip. But we estimate the

02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:54.990
project overall project cost to

02:03:55.769 --> 02:03:57.903
be over 600 million. It's
important to note that we have

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.774
been successful in attracting
some competitive grants and

02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:03.744
discretionary funding sources,
and that continues to be our

02:04:04.678 --> 02:04:06.678
project approach for funding is

02:04:07.915 --> 02:04:10.160
to use the project work that
we've done, as well as the

02:04:10.651 --> 02:04:12.385
funding that we've secured to
attract more funding from the

02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:15.870
federal government and state in

02:04:16.958 --> 02:04:18.993
the form of grants. We
anticipate that the strength of

02:04:18.993 --> 02:04:20.993
this project will will continue

02:04:24.699 --> 02:04:26.699
to attract those grants. Now to

02:04:28.202 --> 02:04:30.336
just give you a brief kind of
overview of some of the work

02:04:30.972 --> 02:04:33.206
that we've been doing with the
risk management on the project,

02:04:34.943 --> 02:04:36.943
we've done a lot of work when it

02:04:38.246 --> 02:04:40.948
comes to the interweaving
questions of risk within the

02:04:42.951 --> 02:04:45.485
project. So as you can see, it's
kind of like a brick wall that

02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:48.870
you're laying a foundation

02:04:48.256 --> 02:04:51.192
that's based on decisions. And
then as you as you continue, you

02:04:51.994 --> 02:04:54.862
have to base more risk decisions
on top of those decisions. And

02:04:55.931 --> 02:04:58.565
so the point that we're that
we're making here is that the a

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:01.468
project that we have has many
unavoidable risks. And some of

02:05:01.703 --> 02:05:03.703
those risks translate directly

02:05:04.472 --> 02:05:07.374
into costs. Some of them are
scheduled risk. And but each one

02:05:08.477 --> 02:05:10.712
of them carries a risk that we
it carries a choice that we have

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.349
to make in terms of are we going
to accept the risk or are we

02:05:15.117 --> 02:05:17.952
going to try to mitigate it
further, which does itself take

02:05:20.288 --> 02:05:22.990
time and money. So an example of
that is, is the risk that we

02:05:24.593 --> 02:05:26.593
have erred where we wanted to

02:05:27.296 --> 02:05:29.331
obtain a system of high quality.
We knew that with our

02:05:31.934 --> 02:05:34.769
procurement strategy, we that we
wouldn't be able to do that with

02:05:35.638 --> 02:05:37.705
a low bid construction type
contract. So we separated out

02:05:38.173 --> 02:05:40.708
the installation work. But by
separating out the installation

02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:44.479
work that created something else
that we that we needed to

02:05:45.581 --> 02:05:47.716
manage. And we and we ultimately
decided in the beginning of that

02:05:49.485 --> 02:05:51.520
of that art exercise that the
risk of sfmta managing a

02:05:52.388 --> 02:05:54.388
separate installer was a lower

02:05:54.991 --> 02:05:57.920
risk than the implications of
having a poor quality train

02:05:57.893 --> 02:06:00.695
control system. And so those are
the types of decisions that

02:06:00.864 --> 02:06:03.565
we're making on a regular basis.
And there are dozens and dozens

02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:08.169
of examples of that in addition

02:06:09.138 --> 02:06:11.373
to help us manage those, the mta
board has created a

02:06:12.842 --> 02:06:15.430
subcommittee. I think we've met
three times in the past year

02:06:15.211 --> 02:06:17.211
that really provides a forum for

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.281
staff to discuss those risks
with the board members. I know

02:06:21.170 --> 02:06:23.586
lately it's been a little bit
difficult because we've been in

02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:26.188
this contracting mode and
haven't been able to express

02:06:26.656 --> 02:06:28.723
everything that we want to
express with the with the

02:06:28.792 --> 02:06:31.930
procurement rules. But soon
we'll be through that phase and

02:06:31.995 --> 02:06:34.362
we'll be able to work together a
little bit more closely on on

02:06:35.733 --> 02:06:38.267
the design questions on
questions of bringing the
installers on board and

02:06:39.269 --> 02:06:42.171
construction. But we did cover a
lot this year. We covered the

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:45.540
overall risks that obsolescence

02:06:46.743 --> 02:06:49.545
poses to metro service risks
that we intend that we expected

02:06:49.546 --> 02:06:51.546
to encounter during this

02:06:52.182 --> 02:06:55.180
procurement process. Risks to
the schedule and how to how to

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.120
communicate those transparently.

02:06:58.489 --> 02:07:01.290
Any pricing that risk, which is
an ongoing effort. And we intend

02:07:01.692 --> 02:07:04.160
to have some more development in
next year about that and

02:07:05.395 --> 02:07:07.395
managing the uncertainty that we

02:07:07.664 --> 02:07:09.664
know exists in the budget as

02:07:10.234 --> 02:07:12.234
well as we really left no stone

02:07:12.303 --> 02:07:15.710
unturned when it came to
researching international best

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.641
practices and lessons learned,
both from sfmta and other

02:07:19.777 --> 02:07:22.712
projects. And we and we did give
get a lot of good feedback from

02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:27.149
the subcommittee. There. So

02:07:27.217 --> 02:07:29.217
moving into our contracting

02:07:31.122 --> 02:07:33.257
strategy, as I mentioned before,
because in part we wanted to

02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:37.127
select a robust train control
supplier and select them on

02:07:37.295 --> 02:07:39.295
their merits and also the

02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:42.465
ability of the supplier to
provide long term support, which
is actually something that mta

02:07:43.434 --> 02:07:45.680
hasn't really done in the past.
It's always been an

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.205
afterthought. You know, you buy
the system and then later you

02:07:49.708 --> 02:07:52.420
get around to doing a sole
source contract for the support.

02:07:53.378 --> 02:07:56.790
We decided, you know, we really
want to put the support up front

02:07:56.748 --> 02:07:59.650
and center. So it is, you know,
we had to go and receive

02:07:59.717 --> 02:08:01.852
permission from the board of
supervisors to negotiate an up

02:08:02.254 --> 02:08:04.322
to 30 year contract, which is
which is a little bit

02:08:04.590 --> 02:08:07.258
groundbreaking working. And by
doing that, we had to create

02:08:08.827 --> 02:08:11.528
this this structure here that
you see on the screen where we

02:08:11.696 --> 02:08:13.697
have the supplier responsible
for providing the system.

02:08:13.698 --> 02:08:16.566
They're also going to be our
design partners. So as soon as

02:08:16.767 --> 02:08:19.536
we get them on board, we're
going to have them really doing

02:08:19.637 --> 02:08:21.637
the heavy lifting in terms of

02:08:21.674 --> 02:08:23.808
designs, requirements that, as I
mentioned, that's the contract,

02:08:24.843 --> 02:08:26.843
that's that. The rfp was issued

02:08:26.912 --> 02:08:29.280
in MARCH and the bids that were
evaluating the contract that

02:08:29.481 --> 02:08:31.481
circled is the one that's before

02:08:31.616 --> 02:08:34.552
you today. MAY the 2nd of the
three, which is the consultant

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:37.720
contract that allows us to

02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:40.925
support our project management.
It provides some international

02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:44.996
expertise, design expertise to
bear on the system and to

02:08:45.197 --> 02:08:46.998
generally support things like
construction management and

02:08:50.469 --> 02:08:52.637
other avenues. And then later,
as we go through each of the

02:08:52.738 --> 02:08:54.738
individual phases, we'll be

02:08:54.841 --> 02:08:57.809
bringing individual rail
installer contracts and the nice

02:08:57.944 --> 02:09:00.112
thing about that approach is
that when we bring those

02:09:00.346 --> 02:09:03.114
installer contracts before you,
they will be based on 100%

02:09:03.716 --> 02:09:05.716
design. So there should be

02:09:06.919 --> 02:09:09.530
little to no risk in in those
because we have worked out all

02:09:10.556 --> 02:09:12.190
the design details and will be
much further along than some of

02:09:13.626 --> 02:09:15.626
the other contracts that we

02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:19.930
typically negotiate. So the

02:09:20.366 --> 02:09:22.668
consultant rfp, as was mentioned
, this is an as needed technical

02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:26.700
services contract supporting

02:09:27.273 --> 02:09:29.441
sfmta. The initial term is for
five years and $25 million.

02:09:31.111 --> 02:09:33.111
We've added five options of one

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.280
year each, bringing the total to

02:09:35.515 --> 02:09:37.515
ten years and not to exceed of

02:09:37.517 --> 02:09:39.517
$36 million. That's that's out

02:09:39.685 --> 02:09:42.287
of an over $600 million budget.
The key rationale, as I

02:09:43.856 --> 02:09:45.791
mentioned, it's part of our risk
management strategy in risks

02:09:46.626 --> 02:09:48.626
pertaining to the project. We

02:09:49.396 --> 02:09:51.497
also have a need to augment our
technical staff acutely when

02:09:52.165 --> 02:09:55.101
we're having difficulty hiring,
particularly engineers, onto the

02:09:56.737 --> 02:09:59.380
project. There is not a lot of
engineering experience in the

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.374
united states, much less the bay
area. And so we've had

02:10:02.642 --> 02:10:04.642
difficulty bringing those

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:06.813
members on as full time staff.
We do have some open positions.

02:10:07.447 --> 02:10:09.782
If anyone is interested in
applying, we'd love to have your

02:10:10.384 --> 02:10:13.219
application, but in the meantime
we'll use the consultants to

02:10:13.486 --> 02:10:15.486
help augment that. We'll also be

02:10:15.822 --> 02:10:18.791
hiring junior engineers in the
hope that they can we can build

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.161
them up and teach them the
knowledge from the consultants

02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:23.161
and have them learn. And then

02:10:23.865 --> 02:10:26.833
we're also going to need a third
party to help us hold the
supplier and the account

02:10:28.690 --> 02:10:30.690
installer accountable to the

02:10:31.772 --> 02:10:34.400
obligations of their contract.
So this is a summary of the

02:10:34.542 --> 02:10:36.576
services that are included in
the consultant rfp, which is

02:10:37.911 --> 02:10:40.146
part of your packet. But in the
general, the general sense, we

02:10:41.449 --> 02:10:43.449
have some project management and

02:10:43.551 --> 02:10:46.453
admin support, construction
management support design and

02:10:47.155 --> 02:10:49.923
engineering. As I mentioned,
they're not going to be the

02:10:50.158 --> 02:10:52.993
designers that's going to be the
supplier, but they will help

02:10:53.127 --> 02:10:55.127
sfmta evaluate those designs

02:10:55.429 --> 02:10:58.131
when we get submittals as system
integration support. So those

02:10:59.934 --> 02:11:01.934
are the number of systems that

02:11:02.403 --> 02:11:05.500
the kbtc will have to talk to,
like our cad system or our

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:09.809
prediction system. We'll have
support there to help us should

02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:14.748
we need it, qa support so sfmta
will have a large qa

02:11:14.850 --> 02:11:16.850
responsibility needing to qa

02:11:18.153 --> 02:11:20.554
both the suppliers designs and
the suppliers equipment as well

02:11:20.956 --> 02:11:22.957
as the installation work that
was done. Testing and

02:11:23.825 --> 02:11:25.825
commissioning will be a large

02:11:25.927 --> 02:11:28.862
part of this project. It I
expect in future years when we

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:30.664
get to that point to be
providing regular updates on

02:11:31.733 --> 02:11:33.733
this progress of that and

02:11:34.103 --> 02:11:36.170
consultant support will help us
again have more eyes, make sure

02:11:37.639 --> 02:11:39.340
that that goes smoothly with
minimal disruption to the

02:11:40.776 --> 02:11:43.277
riding, public safety and
security evaluation is critical

02:11:44.713 --> 02:11:46.713
to the acceptance of the of the

02:11:46.781 --> 02:11:48.781
system from the cpuc, fta and

02:11:48.850 --> 02:11:51.653
other regulatory bodies to
making sure that we get

02:11:51.654 --> 02:11:53.654
authorization to operate the

02:11:54.590 --> 02:11:56.590
system. And then as was

02:11:56.892 --> 02:11:58.892
necessary, we also believe that

02:11:58.994 --> 02:12:00.962
we'll need some post delivery
and operations and maintenance

02:12:01.263 --> 02:12:03.263
consulting because there will be

02:12:03.665 --> 02:12:05.866
a strong learning curve as we
transition our tmc, our field

02:12:06.802 --> 02:12:08.802
staff, our train operators to a

02:12:08.805 --> 02:12:10.805
new system from an old system.

02:12:10.907 --> 02:12:13.108
We don't believe we'll be able
to do that with just the

02:12:13.142 --> 02:12:15.877
supplier. But we'll also need
some consultant support to help

02:12:16.278 --> 02:12:18.278
us create materials and smooth

02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:24.850
that that transition along. So
again, the action before you

02:12:24.887 --> 02:12:27.220
today, we recommend that you
authorize the director of

02:12:28.658 --> 02:12:30.658
transportation to issue an rfp

02:12:31.427 --> 02:12:33.610
for contract 20 2420 fta for
consulting services, supporting

02:12:35.398 --> 02:12:37.398
the kbtc upgrade project and

02:12:38.634 --> 02:12:40.869
again, those terms five years
for 25 million with five options

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.700
to extend for an additional year

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:46.141
for a total of ten years, not to
exceed 36 million. And that

02:12:46.142 --> 02:12:48.142
concludes my presentation. Thank

02:12:48.912 --> 02:12:51.880
you. Thank you, colleagues.
Deputy city attorney susan

02:12:51.948 --> 02:12:54.517
cleveland. Also, I'd like to
make a comment before we come to

02:12:54.517 --> 02:12:56.517
you. Yeah, thank you, chair.

02:12:56.586 --> 02:12:59.870
Deputy city attorney susan
cleveland-knowles. I just wanted

02:13:00.124 --> 02:13:02.358
to follow up on something that I
think dan explained pretty well

02:13:03.527 --> 02:13:05.695
in his presentation. But there
are two separate out things

02:13:06.596 --> 02:13:08.596
underway right now. First is the

02:13:08.765 --> 02:13:11.667
consultant contract, which is
what is in front of you today.

02:13:12.268 --> 02:13:14.268
So that is where the prime

02:13:14.804 --> 02:13:16.804
discussion should focus for

02:13:17.541 --> 02:13:20.900
today. Second, there is an
ongoing evaluation of the

02:13:20.978 --> 02:13:22.978
communication based train

02:13:23.347 --> 02:13:25.347
control system going on, but

02:13:25.983 --> 02:13:27.983
that is in the middle of a

02:13:28.185 --> 02:13:30.219
procurement. So to ensure that
the procurement process is

02:13:31.388 --> 02:13:33.956
conducted fairly, there should
not be information provided to

02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:37.994
the public today regarding
regarding the ongoing

02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:40.764
procurement. So, for example, a
number of bids, the ongoing

02:13:42.299 --> 02:13:44.299
evaluation process, all of that

02:13:46.169 --> 02:13:48.169
is not to be disclosed today. So

02:13:48.338 --> 02:13:50.338
my colleague david ennis, who

02:13:50.407 --> 02:13:52.407
has been advising dan and the

02:13:52.577 --> 02:13:54.577
team on this procurement, is on

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.447
webex, an and I just didn't want
people to be startled if he

02:14:00.170 --> 02:14:02.170
jumps in from the internet to

02:14:03.521 --> 02:14:05.555
interrupt a discussion or a
question. So we'll try to keep

02:14:06.457 --> 02:14:09.158
try to keep the discussion going
down the right track. But I just

02:14:09.928 --> 02:14:11.928
wanted to make sure that was

02:14:12.230 --> 02:14:14.431
understood. And thank you, dan,
for making that fairly clear in

02:14:14.599 --> 02:14:16.599
your presentation. Ann, thanks.

02:14:17.402 --> 02:14:20.340
Thank you so much for the
clarification and I just want to

02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:22.305
also acknowledge the service of
my colleagues, director

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:25.842
hemminger so and henderson on
the train control upgrade

02:14:26.544 --> 02:14:29.347
project subcommittee. And so
we'd love to open it up to you

02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:32.349
all first, if you have any
thoughts or recommendations for

02:14:32.450 --> 02:14:34.585
director henzi and myself, and I
think I saw you, director

02:14:37.855 --> 02:14:39.855
henderson, raise your hand first

02:14:51.403 --> 02:14:53.637
. Sure. Is that me? Yes. So our
to our council. I'd like to ask

02:14:54.473 --> 02:14:57.700
a question about the other
contract. Are you saying I can't

02:14:57.342 --> 02:14:59.342
ask any questions about it? Or

02:14:59.811 --> 02:15:02.120
just those related to the
current evaluation of the

02:15:06.852 --> 02:15:09.654
proposals. I'll let david
clarify, but I think it's mostly

02:15:09.788 --> 02:15:12.390
related to the evaluation of the
proposals. But david, do you

02:15:12.458 --> 02:15:14.458
have anything to add? Yeah, this

02:15:15.694 --> 02:15:17.694
is deputy city attorney david

02:15:18.730 --> 02:15:21.199
innes. Um you can ask about the
public information about the

02:15:22.235 --> 02:15:24.235
ongoing procurement. In fact,

02:15:24.303 --> 02:15:26.738
the rfp was reviewed and
approved by the board, but any

02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:30.740
information regarding the

02:15:31.477 --> 02:15:33.477
progress the any details on

02:15:35.247 --> 02:15:37.482
participants, even what is going
on on our side regarding the

02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:39.650
ongoing evaluation of the

02:15:39.752 --> 02:15:42.621
proposals is protected
information and shouldn't be

02:15:43.289 --> 02:15:45.289
disclosed at this point. At the

02:15:45.525 --> 02:15:48.193
risk of potentially undermining
the process and requiring it to

02:15:48.961 --> 02:15:50.961
be started over again. Okay.

02:15:51.997 --> 02:15:54.566
Well, maybe just to avoid heart
attacks here, I'll I'll defer

02:15:57.300 --> 02:15:59.300
the question about the contract

02:15:59.139 --> 02:16:01.139
to another time. I think it

02:16:01.974 --> 02:16:03.974
would be helpful, dan, to hear

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:07.946
about about how you built the
cost estimate for the contract

02:16:09.115 --> 02:16:11.115
that is before us today. Okay.

02:16:12.953 --> 02:16:14.953
It's a lot of money, but it's

02:16:15.422 --> 02:16:17.422
also an investment in an even

02:16:17.457 --> 02:16:19.457
bigger sum of money that we're

02:16:21.528 --> 02:16:23.528
going to be be seeking approval

02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.640
for later. So where did where

02:16:27.967 --> 02:16:30.503
did this number come from? Thank
you for the question. The number

02:16:32.539 --> 02:16:34.539
came from it started out as a as

02:16:35.775 --> 02:16:37.775
a round and a percentage figure

02:16:39.446 --> 02:16:41.714
of the overall cost. We looked
at that as a kind of ground

02:16:42.382 --> 02:16:45.351
truth to make sure we weren't
out of out of whack. This is an

02:16:45.852 --> 02:16:47.852
as needed contract. So the

02:16:48.756 --> 02:16:51.724
number that you're seeing before
you is a cap that that I don't

02:16:52.126 --> 02:16:54.126
intend to hit. I expect it

02:16:56.196 --> 02:16:58.196
actually to be less. There are

02:16:58.331 --> 02:17:00.331
significant services that are in

02:17:00.701 --> 02:17:03.202
this contract for example, with
system integration services that

02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:06.710
sfmta intends to self-perform.

02:17:06.507 --> 02:17:08.507
Um, and so those, those

02:17:08.543 --> 02:17:10.543
provisions in the contract are

02:17:11.979 --> 02:17:13.979
kind of an insurance policy that

02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:16.816
if we need additional support,
it's there. So we based our

02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.220
annual estimate of one point. It

02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:25.570
was 1.3 a year as million a year

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.940
based on actual number of hours

02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:31.965
that we would use using
comparable sfmta

02:17:33.201 --> 02:17:35.201
classifications. So that that

02:17:35.636 --> 02:17:38.400
wound up being less than the
overall amount. And then we

02:17:39.408 --> 02:17:42.243
added a little we had about 25%
contingency fee. And then

02:17:42.444 --> 02:17:44.444
bounced that off of the overall

02:17:44.812 --> 02:17:46.413
project cost. So as I said, we
expect to spend less than the

02:17:50.652 --> 02:17:52.652
cap, but the cap was was put in

02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:56.389
place also to include and

02:17:57.626 --> 02:18:00.294
inflation as well over the over
the ten year life of the

02:18:00.295 --> 02:18:02.263
project. And this is a
professional services contract,

02:18:02.297 --> 02:18:04.297
right? So we're not talking

02:18:04.499 --> 02:18:06.499
about low bid or anything like

02:18:06.501 --> 02:18:09.436
that. Yeah. So the way that
we'll receive bids will be they

02:18:09.604 --> 02:18:12.720
won't be bidding on the overall
the overall cap number that you

02:18:13.174 --> 02:18:15.277
see before you. That's not going
to change through negotiations.

02:18:15.277 --> 02:18:17.277
What is going to change is the

02:18:18.281 --> 02:18:20.515
rates. So we're going to we're
going to be negotiating salary
rates, which is essentially to

02:18:21.283 --> 02:18:23.417
me as a pm, that's that's how
fast are we accelerating towards

02:18:25.587 --> 02:18:28.289
that cap. And so we will be
looking at that. And we will be

02:18:31.661 --> 02:18:34.563
looking at essentially the year
over year expenditures. But we

02:18:35.364 --> 02:18:37.364
won't we won't necessarily use

02:18:39.668 --> 02:18:42.604
it all. Okay and colleagues, let
me just make one last point and

02:18:44.741 --> 02:18:46.741
then ask my new fellow committee

02:18:46.809 --> 02:18:49.710
members. One thing. The chair
able was able to pull off is to

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:53.448
remove herself from this
committee by appointing the rest

02:18:55.718 --> 02:18:57.718
of us to it. But that's, you

02:18:57.887 --> 02:18:59.887
know, power has its privileges

02:19:01.157 --> 02:19:03.157
as the last thing I wanted to

02:19:04.326 --> 02:19:06.326
talk about is risk and risk

02:19:08.331 --> 02:19:10.331
management. And I commend the

02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:12.700
staff for taking that question

02:19:12.902 --> 02:19:14.902
head on and seriously, we

02:19:15.371 --> 02:19:17.371
obviously, we have had the

02:19:18.341 --> 02:19:21.420
ability to benefit from a couple
of risky projects that we just

02:19:22.678 --> 02:19:25.180
finished. I think there's
probably a limited amount of

02:19:26.416 --> 02:19:28.416
transference of knowledge there

02:19:28.885 --> 02:19:30.719
because the other two projects
were big honking civil

02:19:32.956 --> 02:19:34.956
construction on and this is

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.920
really a software job and those

02:19:38.828 --> 02:19:40.895
can be the worst if you follow
the industry in terms of

02:19:42.666 --> 02:19:45.568
remember how long it took the
state of california to get a new

02:19:49.773 --> 02:19:51.773
dmv computer. So given the fact

02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:54.977
that it is a unique contract, i
think that emphasizes all the

02:19:59.450 --> 02:20:01.450
more that we really take the

02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:04.190
risk question seriously, I think

02:20:04.121 --> 02:20:06.121
you're covering in the areas

02:20:06.656 --> 02:20:08.656
that ought to be covered. The

02:20:08.892 --> 02:20:10.892
one that we're not covering and

02:20:12.362 --> 02:20:15.131
really aren't able to do is the
donald rumsfeld the unknown

02:20:17.468 --> 02:20:19.468
unknowns at and I think a good

02:20:20.805 --> 02:20:22.805
robust risk process takes

02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:25.809
account of the fact that there
are things we don't know. And we

02:20:27.478 --> 02:20:29.478
really can't know them at the

02:20:30.247 --> 02:20:32.247
beginning of the work. And we

02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:34.950
have to build in some what I

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:39.189
would call humility into
estimates. We make of time and

02:20:42.226 --> 02:20:45.610
cost and I know you've heard me
talk about it until you're

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:48.640
probably sick of it, but I do

02:20:48.866 --> 02:20:50.834
think we need to factor in that
element of risk as well. The

02:20:51.903 --> 02:20:54.571
risks that we don't know,
because very often the one you

02:20:55.707 --> 02:20:57.707
don't know is the one that

02:20:59.210 --> 02:21:02.790
really kills you. So again,
thanks for the effort. Thanks

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:04.800
for keeping our committee

02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:06.349
informed. I know the last time

02:21:07.218 --> 02:21:09.218
we met I was out of town, so I

02:21:10.155 --> 02:21:12.890
believe you met with the other
two members. And I'd certainly

02:21:13.558 --> 02:21:16.527
like to give them a chance to
make their comments. Now okay.

02:21:21.499 --> 02:21:23.499
Thank you, director. So please.

02:21:23.835 --> 02:21:25.835
Thank you for sharing your

02:21:27.239 --> 02:21:29.239
knowledge. It's amazing. I love

02:21:32.770 --> 02:21:34.770
this. I just want to piggyback

02:21:35.470 --> 02:21:37.648
rye on what my fellow director,
peter hemminger, said that the

02:21:40.819 --> 02:21:42.987
unknown is the usually is the
one that throw us off the track.

02:21:45.658 --> 02:21:48.326
So in your $36 million budget,
what is your contingency

02:21:52.197 --> 02:21:55.660
percentage. For the for the
consultant and contract? It's

02:21:55.167 --> 02:21:57.167
25% across the project. It's

02:21:57.402 --> 02:22:00.104
actually 25% as well. But
director hemminger was I think

02:22:00.939 --> 02:22:03.208
was alluding to we have more
work to do next year. We what we

02:22:04.811 --> 02:22:06.678
did with the building, the
project up again, we're at an

02:22:07.447 --> 02:22:10.215
early stage in the project so
we're we're using building
blocks, rough order of magnitude

02:22:11.617 --> 02:22:14.252
estimates and now we're only
starting to kind of crest the

02:22:14.386 --> 02:22:16.386
surface and get into some more

02:22:16.555 --> 02:22:18.623
of the details now that we're
getting proposals. And when we

02:22:18.857 --> 02:22:21.794
get into design. So the work
that we have ahead of us, I

02:22:22.395 --> 02:22:25.197
believe, on top of that is to
identify risks and price those

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:29.768
individually while maintain our
25% contingency for the unknown

02:22:32.938 --> 02:22:34.938
unknowns. Okay that's do you do

02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.879
you think that 25% is kind of in
the higher end side for content

02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:43.180
agency? Just wanted to get a

02:22:44.170 --> 02:22:46.385
sense of scale here. I believe
it's about standard for

02:22:47.253 --> 02:22:49.421
projects, for professional. It's
about middle of the road. Yeah.

02:22:53.126 --> 02:22:55.528
Okay um, your slide about
putting the three different

02:22:58.332 --> 02:23:00.332
contract outs in the same page,

02:23:00.367 --> 02:23:02.367
it was very helpful. So thank

02:23:03.403 --> 02:23:05.403
you. And my understanding is the

02:23:06.706 --> 02:23:08.706
supplier, the rfp already you

02:23:08.875 --> 02:23:11.343
already received all the
proposal and that's in the

02:23:12.747 --> 02:23:14.747
procurement. Yes. So now we're

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:18.160
talking about the consultant rfp

02:23:18.185 --> 02:23:20.185
. I'm trying to understand the

02:23:24.624 --> 02:23:26.624
timeline about the consultant

02:23:28.361 --> 02:23:31.331
rfp. When we award them the
contract, would it be in sync

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:34.660
with the same schedule of when

02:23:34.435 --> 02:23:36.435
we award the supplier contract?

02:23:37.404 --> 02:23:39.404
Because I've tried to see that I

02:23:40.908 --> 02:23:42.908
would assume when we have these

02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:45.210
engineers and experts in traffic

02:23:47.315 --> 02:23:49.315
control, what they propose for

02:23:50.351 --> 02:23:52.351
us to do only makes sense if our

02:23:52.453 --> 02:23:54.453
supplier has the capacity to

02:23:55.756 --> 02:23:58.491
deliver. So it's a chicken and
an egg thing. So I like to know

02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:02.695
are is it am I am I wrong or am
i right or what's what's our

02:24:04.566 --> 02:24:06.566
plan? No no, I think it's a good

02:24:06.935 --> 02:24:08.935
question. I think so. The

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:11.839
supplier rfp was much more
complex than this as needed

02:24:13.174 --> 02:24:15.174
services contract. So it

02:24:15.176 --> 02:24:18.111
required it requires a much
longer process to work out

02:24:18.913 --> 02:24:21.548
through all the details. Our
intent is, is we issued that one

02:24:23.418 --> 02:24:25.418
first. So it started ahead of us

02:24:26.254 --> 02:24:28.254
right? But we plan to issue the

02:24:28.857 --> 02:24:30.857
consultant rfp now and have that

02:24:31.659 --> 02:24:33.894
basically catch up. If you
imagine them in a race. And so

02:24:34.762 --> 02:24:36.762
our goal is when they when we

02:24:36.998 --> 02:24:39.533
get to the finish line and when
we come back to you for contract

02:24:40.569 --> 02:24:42.703
approval, that we'll be able to
present you both the supplier

02:24:43.438 --> 02:24:45.473
and the consultant around the
same board meeting. So they

02:24:46.275 --> 02:24:48.509
should come at the same time,
which will then mean that when

02:24:49.544 --> 02:24:51.544
we give the supplier rfp or np,

02:24:52.647 --> 02:24:54.647
that we're giving the consultant

02:24:54.749 --> 02:24:56.749
np right around the same time as

02:24:56.852 --> 02:24:58.620
well. So we want them both to
come on board at the same time.

02:24:59.688 --> 02:25:01.956
And that was how we designed the
process. Okay, great. And didn't

02:25:02.725 --> 02:25:04.959
have the luxury to read the
draft rfp, but I think I

02:25:05.627 --> 02:25:07.627
remember I mentioned it to you

02:25:08.797 --> 02:25:10.797
in our first historical teacup

02:25:11.333 --> 02:25:13.333
meeting. Thank you for the

02:25:15.638 --> 02:25:17.638
orientations. The sp and db goal

02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:21.760
of 15. I like to see that we
actually also have micro lba for

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.280
our san francisco, so minority

02:25:26.381 --> 02:25:28.381
business contract participations

02:25:28.917 --> 02:25:31.719
. Yes. And is virginia harmon on
the phone to speak to? Yeah.

02:25:36.259 --> 02:25:38.794
Great. Virginia harmon. Good
afternoon chair ekin members of

02:25:39.929 --> 02:25:42.631
the board director tumlin
virginia harmon. I am the

02:25:42.732 --> 02:25:44.766
manager of the contract
compliance office. I'm the

02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:49.360
agency db liaison officer. And

02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:51.774
you ask a very good question.
What about the microbes? Well

02:25:51.941 --> 02:25:53.941
they can participate on this

02:25:58.348 --> 02:26:00.282
project because we are presently
implementing two different types

02:26:02.518 --> 02:26:04.686
of programs. One is the lba
program. Um, and we use that

02:26:05.221 --> 02:26:07.221
program when projects are

02:26:08.692 --> 02:26:10.760
locally funded and the other is
our dbe program. When the

02:26:12.329 --> 02:26:14.329
projects are federally funded,

02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:18.990
our dbe program requires us to

02:26:19.936 --> 02:26:21.936
set an sp goal. And for firms to

02:26:22.572 --> 02:26:24.572
achieve that goal, they have to

02:26:25.976 --> 02:26:27.976
be certified as dbs under the

02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:31.380
dot program. Sbs under the state

02:26:31.381 --> 02:26:33.381
of california department of

02:26:33.617 --> 02:26:36.452
general services program or or
lbz under the city's local

02:26:37.187 --> 02:26:39.621
business enterprise program. So
firms can participate in that

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:43.259
way. On this project. And as you

02:26:44.228 --> 02:26:46.896
know, the goal is set at 15. Sp
participation. So we're looking

02:26:50.701 --> 02:26:52.902
to see dbs. Sbs and lbi's lisd
bid by the prime bidders to

02:26:54.504 --> 02:26:56.504
achieve those goals. Okay so

02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.676
there are opportunities there
for this. This project is highly

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:05.315
specialized and but we did work
in consultation with the project

02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:08.852
team and identified that there
were some opportunities still,

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:10.920
in spite of the highly
specialized nature of the work

02:27:11.956 --> 02:27:13.956
and some of those areas are, you

02:27:14.910 --> 02:27:16.526
know, project management or
construction management work,

02:27:19.564 --> 02:27:21.732
administrate on contract
management work and all of those

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.635
areas. And we're hoping to see
sp participation there. Okay,

02:27:25.903 --> 02:27:28.710
great. Thank you very much. Does
that answer your question? It

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.708
does. Okay. Thank you. DR.

02:27:34.946 --> 02:27:37.681
Henderson, please. Virginia I
have a question for you. I think

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:42.184
just along that line of the

02:27:44.222 --> 02:27:46.222
business goals, I'm curious if

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:49.425
there I think I heard that there

02:27:49.861 --> 02:27:52.830
are some uncertainty with just
how much of the 600 million will

02:27:53.398 --> 02:27:55.398
be paid from different sources.

02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:00.571
So if we run into a windfall and
it's, you know, a different

02:28:01.406 --> 02:28:04.341
source than anticipated, so if
it's a federal source or a state

02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:07.610
source, and we expected it to be

02:28:07.879 --> 02:28:09.879
something different, does that

02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:13.550
change at all the sp or db

02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:16.620
goals? No so it will likely not

02:28:16.955 --> 02:28:18.955
change in the circumstance.

02:28:19.391 --> 02:28:21.391
Typically when we fund projects

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.661
with federal money, there's a
requirement that we use the

02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:26.764
federal program so we can't
switch back to the local program

02:28:26.866 --> 02:28:29.100
just because we got some more
local money. So we're we'll be

02:28:30.869 --> 02:28:32.869
stuck in this federal program,

02:28:33.639 --> 02:28:35.639
but it's okay because in fact,

02:28:37.109 --> 02:28:39.911
we are are able to accept the
certifications under the sba

02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:43.140
program that we're presently
implementing. Oh, you are? Yes,

02:28:44.951 --> 02:28:47.486
we do accept certifications
under our sba program. Okay. Got

02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:51.880
it. Okay. And then in terms of

02:28:55.328 --> 02:28:57.328
the outreach or excuse me,

02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:59.429
preparation for these businesses

02:29:01.301 --> 02:29:04.136
to be competitive, is there
something specific that you are

02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:07.773
doing that maybe you have not
done in the past that you expect

02:29:08.441 --> 02:29:10.441
to be able to reach these goals

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:13.679
better? Well, we do routine
outreach, you know, throughout

02:29:14.747 --> 02:29:17.315
throughout the year on all of
our projects and all of the

02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:20.120
projects that we're planning to
bid on this project. In

02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.688
particular, though, we've been
meeting with the community and

02:29:25.825 --> 02:29:28.794
of small businesses and have
discussed with them the
opportunities that are upcoming.

02:29:29.696 --> 02:29:32.531
Okay. Thank you. And I just
wanted to say finally in

02:29:32.665 --> 02:29:35.467
wrapping up, I think we had a
really robust discussion on at

02:29:36.970 --> 02:29:38.972
the teacup meeting on friday and
I really appreciate this

02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:43.800
presentation on and the way

02:29:44.211 --> 02:29:46.211
staff was able to make this very

02:29:48.381 --> 02:29:50.381
complex and long term project

02:29:50.617 --> 02:29:52.617
understandable in bite size

02:29:53.860 --> 02:29:55.860
pieces. I think that the well,

02:29:56.490 --> 02:29:59.392
not the concern, but the thing
that came out of it to me is

02:30:00.427 --> 02:30:03.620
that this is such a long term
project and it's sort of the way

02:30:03.197 --> 02:30:05.197
the approach that you all are

02:30:05.933 --> 02:30:08.340
taking is pretty not unusual,
but it's something that you're

02:30:10.304 --> 02:30:13.240
testing out. And so I do hope
that we really do keep track of

02:30:15.476 --> 02:30:17.476
the lessons learned so that in

02:30:17.945 --> 02:30:19.945
however many decades when you're

02:30:20.147 --> 02:30:22.749
putting the little microchip on
the screen to show the outdated

02:30:24.551 --> 02:30:26.551
technology that the staff of

02:30:27.554 --> 02:30:29.554
this agency will be able to will

02:30:29.657 --> 02:30:31.657
have those breadcrumbs that can

02:30:33.161 --> 02:30:35.161
help lead them to a solution in

02:30:36.831 --> 02:30:38.831
in the next upgrade. So please

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:42.202
do keep that in mind. You know,
just the institutional knowledge

02:30:43.704 --> 02:30:46.339
and figuring out a way to make
sure that that that this process

02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:50.210
is memorialized in a way that

02:30:50.745 --> 02:30:52.745
can be helpful. So that maybe

02:30:54.348 --> 02:30:56.348
the next upgrade is shorter or

02:31:00.655 --> 02:31:02.655
maybe more affordable and the

02:31:03.959 --> 02:31:05.959
other thing that I wanted to

02:31:05.994 --> 02:31:07.994
just have a good understanding

02:31:08.130 --> 02:31:10.865
about is or a little bit of
clarity about is that we

02:31:10.866 --> 02:31:12.866
anticipate bringing the other

02:31:14.936 --> 02:31:17.871
contracts in a couple of months,
right? The supplier, is there an

02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:21.508
additional contract that's going
to come with that or is just the

02:31:24.713 --> 02:31:26.914
supplier box? Yeah. So next year
, as we think around the summer

02:31:27.949 --> 02:31:30.840
is when we'll plan to bring the
supplier and the consultant

02:31:31.530 --> 02:31:33.530
contracts to you. There is the

02:31:33.255 --> 02:31:35.689
installer contracts, but we're
going to bring those one at a

02:31:36.591 --> 02:31:38.559
time as we start the
construction of each phase. So

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:41.280
those won't be for several

02:31:41.297 --> 02:31:43.297
years. Okay. All right. Thank

02:31:43.766 --> 02:31:45.867
you. If after all of the comment
and everything, I would like to

02:31:47.303 --> 02:31:49.303
move the item. Okay. Thank you,

02:31:49.538 --> 02:31:51.538
director tomlin. Yes, I wanted

02:31:51.807 --> 02:31:53.807
to thank director hemminger for

02:31:53.976 --> 02:31:56.444
his comment about risk and being
transparent about risk. The

02:31:58.514 --> 02:32:00.514
reason why the subway is working

02:32:00.516 --> 02:32:02.584
better today than it has in
decades is not because we have

02:32:03.386 --> 02:32:06.210
more resources, but rather
because the team has been really

02:32:06.822 --> 02:32:09.791
thoughtful about risk and
communication in trying new

02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:13.261
approaches in order to operate
it better and maintain it

02:32:15.231 --> 02:32:17.767
better. I think we've learned a
lot over the last couple of

02:32:17.767 --> 02:32:20.202
years about the necessity of
being very up front and

02:32:21.404 --> 02:32:23.404
transparent about the risks and

02:32:23.973 --> 02:32:26.307
things that we worry about and
tracking those over time so that

02:32:27.743 --> 02:32:29.743
we can make course corrections

02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:32.460
continually as well as build

02:32:33.450 --> 02:32:36.151
trust. The presentation that dan
, I believe gave to the train

02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:40.122
control subcommittee had a much
longer discussion about risk,

02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:43.559
which dan also presented to the
entire executive team and will

02:32:44.227 --> 02:32:46.194
be using as a model moving
forward so that we're

02:32:46.763 --> 02:32:48.763
continually reporting on the

02:32:49.466 --> 02:32:51.901
things that are worrying us,
whether it's schedule or cost or

02:32:52.269 --> 02:32:54.269
installation concerns or

02:32:54.504 --> 02:32:56.504
contractor concerns as we want

02:32:57.730 --> 02:32:59.942
to be very transparent about all
of that rather than hide the

02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:02.770
problem because it's through
transparency that we can

02:33:03.513 --> 02:33:05.513
actually deliver this project

02:33:06.317 --> 02:33:08.317
successfully. This is something

02:33:08.519 --> 02:33:10.420
that we are modeling in our
capital programs and

02:33:10.621 --> 02:33:12.422
construction division as well as
throughout the transit division.

02:33:13.257 --> 02:33:15.658
And I'm hoping that it will be
the model for the rest of the

02:33:15.992 --> 02:33:18.528
agency in terms of managing
complex projects. Yes. And

02:33:19.796 --> 02:33:22.498
finally, I need to I need to
correct the record. Previously,

02:33:23.701 --> 02:33:26.669
I have made statements
erroneously stating that our

02:33:28.773 --> 02:33:30.773
train control system is loaded

02:33:31.442 --> 02:33:33.442
off of 1976, era 5.25in floppy

02:33:34.812 --> 02:33:36.812
disks. I stand corrected and

02:33:39.516 --> 02:33:41.516
note that it is loaded off of

02:33:43.988 --> 02:33:46.690
1980s era 3.5in disks. We are
much further ahead in our
technological development than I

02:33:47.391 --> 02:33:49.391
had previously stated, and I

02:33:50.928 --> 02:33:53.763
want the record to reflect that.
Thank you, director hensley.

02:33:56.633 --> 02:33:58.633
Please awesome. Thank you. And

02:33:59.304 --> 02:34:01.304
thank you again to my colleagues

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:04.240
for serving on the train control

02:34:04.776 --> 02:34:06.776
subcommittee. I think this is

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:10.680
making this item easier for

02:34:10.715 --> 02:34:12.715
chicken, and I do just have one

02:34:14.619 --> 02:34:16.619
question for dan on, um, that

02:34:17.322 --> 02:34:19.322
you expressed a desire to

02:34:20.926 --> 02:34:22.926
hopefully we spend less on this

02:34:23.361 --> 02:34:25.361
contract, on this contract, but

02:34:25.397 --> 02:34:27.397
it being an as needed contract

02:34:29.167 --> 02:34:31.167
out to that end, I was wondering

02:34:32.503 --> 02:34:34.806
and you showed in one of your
final slides, you showed

02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:38.740
possible service that might be

02:34:38.444 --> 02:34:40.444
included in this contract. But

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:43.880
will you be requiring whoever

02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.180
the subcontractor is to submit

02:34:48.186 --> 02:34:50.186
scopes of work? Often that are

02:34:50.355 --> 02:34:53.158
specific, like every year, once
a year, you know, so to help

02:34:55.761 --> 02:34:57.761
kind of control the cost cost on

02:35:00.265 --> 02:35:02.967
that. Yeah thank you for the
question that speaks to the way

02:35:05.103 --> 02:35:07.238
we intend to manage the contract
, which is through an annual

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:11.843
work plan. So each year on the
anniversary of the contract, we

02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:15.450
would go over with the

02:35:15.247 --> 02:35:17.247
consultant team the expected

02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:19.950
tasks that we expect to have

02:35:19.952 --> 02:35:22.553
them accomplish and help us with
through the year. So it'll be

02:35:22.922 --> 02:35:24.755
part of our annual project
planning discussions. We can

02:35:26.192 --> 02:35:28.127
also meet with them more
frequently if we if an urgent

02:35:29.696 --> 02:35:31.530
needs arise. But at least every
year we'll go over that with

02:35:31.731 --> 02:35:34.700
them and we'll essentially be
selecting from that menu that

02:35:35.634 --> 02:35:38.360
you saw. And under that menu
there are subheadings of

02:35:38.838 --> 02:35:41.172
individual of the types of other
individual supporting tasks of

02:35:42.341 --> 02:35:44.944
which of those tasks we feel
like we'll need. So we

02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:47.110
definitely won't there won't

02:35:47.581 --> 02:35:49.448
ever be a year. I mean, knock on
wood, I don't think they'll ever

02:35:50.483 --> 02:35:53.351
be a year where we need all of
those in one year, right? Like

02:35:53.987 --> 02:35:56.255
there there's going to be some
that are going to lie dormant,

02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:58.423
you know, there's one about post
delivery support. We're

02:35:58.558 --> 02:36:00.558
obviously not going to need that

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.430
till the end of the project, but
the so we'll be selecting from

02:36:03.430 --> 02:36:05.310
those and then the consulting
will essentially build their

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.801
team for the year. They need to
understand and plan their

02:36:10.270 --> 02:36:12.771
workflow and so the structure of
the rfp is reflects that as

02:36:13.573 --> 02:36:15.908
well. We as opposed to some
other as needed contracts, we're

02:36:16.543 --> 02:36:18.543
not asking the consultant to

02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.280
commit a large number of staff

02:36:21.281 --> 02:36:23.281
exclusively to this project and

02:36:23.517 --> 02:36:25.517
to locate them here because we

02:36:25.952 --> 02:36:27.953
know or we intend not to use
them frequently enough to

02:36:29.155 --> 02:36:31.155
require that. So we've required

02:36:32.159 --> 02:36:34.226
a small number of staff to serve
for continuity purposes as the

02:36:35.610 --> 02:36:37.664
project management staff. When I
say small, I'm saying about

02:36:39.333 --> 02:36:42.101
four. And then and then then
they're meant to identify by

02:36:43.537 --> 02:36:45.538
their lead personnel. They're
experts in each of those

02:36:45.672 --> 02:36:47.672
different disciplines who MAY be

02:36:48.776 --> 02:36:50.510
assigned to other projects, but
who we expect to be available

02:36:51.345 --> 02:36:53.345
for ours. Now that's where the

02:36:54.820 --> 02:36:56.716
devil will be in the details is
availability of individual

02:36:57.819 --> 02:37:00.687
staff. And so we'll be each one
of those annual work plans will

02:37:03.769 --> 02:37:05.240
be kind of a negotiation of
sorts between the consultant

02:37:07.129 --> 02:37:08.594
team and the project team in
terms of who we're getting, what

02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:12.499
the overall level of effort or
number of hours is and cost. And

02:37:14.135 --> 02:37:16.870
we'll be using that as a
mechanism to control costs so

02:37:17.405 --> 02:37:19.405
that we remain under the cap.

02:37:19.807 --> 02:37:22.542
Perfect. Sounds like there's a
responsible plan in place for

02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:26.747
that. And so, MADAM Chair, after
discussion in public comment,

02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:31.786
I'll I'll will gladly. Second
director henderson's motion of

02:37:33.655 --> 02:37:35.655
approval. Thank you. Thank you,

02:37:36.491 --> 02:37:39.326
director hensley. Colleagues I
will open it up to public

02:37:40.595 --> 02:37:42.595
comment at this point for those

02:37:44.132 --> 02:37:46.901
in the room, any speakers is
seeing none. Please open a

02:37:47.469 --> 02:37:49.236
remote at this time. We'll move
to remote public comment not to

02:37:50.105 --> 02:37:52.440
exceed a total time of ten
minutes. Members of the public

02:37:53.575 --> 02:37:55.576
wishing to comment should dial
star three to enter the queue.

02:37:55.744 --> 02:37:57.744
Each speaker will have two

02:37:59.314 --> 02:38:01.314
minutes. Moderator for speaker

02:38:02.183 --> 02:38:04.586
for. Thank you. Good afternoon.
Chair amanda egan, alita dupree.

02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:07.789
For the record, she and her I
request your leave to speak on

02:38:09.191 --> 02:38:12.260
this train control item and I
have standing. This is very

02:38:14.663 --> 02:38:16.663
important and I haven't been on

02:38:18.366 --> 02:38:20.366
the subway in a while, but I

02:38:20.770 --> 02:38:23.572
have been on the subway at times
when things were not quite

02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:29.770
working as right as I hoped. And
while it has improved, yes, i

02:38:30.446 --> 02:38:32.446
learned something new today

02:38:33.248 --> 02:38:35.248
about these floppy disks and 80s

02:38:36.518 --> 02:38:38.518
technology things I had in high

02:38:39.656 --> 02:38:41.656
school. So I think we have to

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.862
work at improve this. I can't
say I have a long history with

02:38:48.831 --> 02:38:50.831
writing on the subway in san

02:38:52.601 --> 02:38:54.601
francisco, so it goes back to

02:38:56.573 --> 02:38:58.573
2009. But I do have this summer

02:38:58.775 --> 02:39:00.775
a resume of using communication

02:39:02.312 --> 02:39:04.312
based train control in new york

02:39:04.647 --> 02:39:07.616
city. On there train system,
which is actually called a

02:39:09.953 --> 02:39:11.953
subway. Perhaps some of you have

02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:15.458
gotten to see it and use it and
the kbtc does perform markedly

02:39:18.762 --> 02:39:20.896
better than the than the systems
or the older systems, some of

02:39:24.670 --> 02:39:26.670
which are 80 years old. So I

02:39:27.537 --> 02:39:29.705
enjoy my time riding on the
seven line and some of those

02:39:30.674 --> 02:39:32.674
other new sections. So I hope we

02:39:33.677 --> 02:39:35.778
can do this work quickly and
there's going to be more

02:39:37.948 --> 02:39:40.182
contracts coming along. But I
want to have the best subway

02:39:41.117 --> 02:39:43.117
that we can for san francisco

02:39:44.254 --> 02:39:46.989
and I'd like to see how train
control works on the surface, I

02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:49.190
guess. I guess we're going to

02:39:49.527 --> 02:39:51.428
turn the trains into autonomous
vehicles. That'll be very

02:39:51.862 --> 02:39:53.862
interesting because I follow

02:39:54.165 --> 02:39:56.165
that. So. So I appreciate it.

02:39:56.367 --> 02:39:58.367
And thank you for the welcome

02:39:59.370 --> 02:40:01.370
that you have shown me to speak

02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:04.380
on this. Thank you. No

02:40:05.977 --> 02:40:07.977
additional speakers. Okay that

02:40:10.281 --> 02:40:12.282
will close public comment at so
colleagues, this subcommittee is

02:40:13.154 --> 02:40:15.154
a little bit of a an unusual

02:40:15.419 --> 02:40:18.154
format for us. We haven't done
this too much the way the board

02:40:18.355 --> 02:40:21.324
of supervisors does. But if any
of you do have a recommendation

02:40:22.293 --> 02:40:25.950
for us to consider now or in the
future going forward, I'd be

02:40:25.330 --> 02:40:27.330
happy to hear that. Just because

02:40:27.665 --> 02:40:30.567
you're able to dive much deeper
into the topic. But director
henderson, I think you had a

02:40:34.539 --> 02:40:36.539
motion. There was a motion and a

02:40:36.874 --> 02:40:39.609
second. Great. Let's call the
roll on the motion to approve

02:40:40.211 --> 02:40:41.779
director heminger heminger.
Director henderson henderson

02:40:46.517 --> 02:40:48.517
director hinsey. Hi director. So

02:40:50.588 --> 02:40:52.823
I. So I chair egan. I egan, I
thank you. The item is approved.

02:40:53.525 --> 02:40:55.459
Thank you. Please call item 12.
Item number 12 approving an

02:40:57.728 --> 02:40:59.728
amendment to the sfmta's zero

02:40:59.831 --> 02:41:01.866
emission vehicle policy to allow
for future trolley bus

02:41:02.768 --> 02:41:04.768
acquisition in and extend the

02:41:05.671 --> 02:41:07.771
timeline for achieving a 100%
zero emission fleet to align

02:41:07.772 --> 02:41:09.772
with the california air

02:41:10.475 --> 02:41:12.475
resources board and innovate

02:41:12.477 --> 02:41:14.477
their board's innovative clean

02:41:15.447 --> 02:41:17.447
transit ict regulation timeline,

02:41:20.953 --> 02:41:22.953
which is currently 2040. Good

02:41:22.955 --> 02:41:24.955
afternoon. Julie kirschbaum,

02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:27.900
transit director. Thank you for

02:41:27.192 --> 02:41:29.192
the opportunity to bring to you

02:41:30.862 --> 02:41:32.862
a recommendation to modify our

02:41:34.834 --> 02:41:36.834
bus electrification policy. Our

02:41:36.969 --> 02:41:38.969
road to low and zero emissions

02:41:39.538 --> 02:41:41.538
vehicles is a program that I'm

02:41:41.941 --> 02:41:44.800
very proud of. I want to talk
today about some of the

02:41:44.944 --> 02:41:46.944
highlights of that program as

02:41:47.212 --> 02:41:49.212
well as where we think our

02:41:49.548 --> 02:41:51.548
policy work needs to go in order

02:41:52.510 --> 02:41:54.510
to continue that success. This

02:41:55.755 --> 02:41:57.755
addressing the climate crisis is

02:41:58.257 --> 02:42:01.193
a core value driving our work.
It's one we talk about a lot and

02:42:02.194 --> 02:42:04.194
is articulated in our citywide

02:42:04.396 --> 02:42:06.396
climate action plan. Our biggest

02:42:06.465 --> 02:42:08.465
challenge is the transport

02:42:09.302 --> 02:42:11.302
sector, which makes up 44% of

02:42:11.338 --> 02:42:13.338
san francisco's greenhouse gas

02:42:15.975 --> 02:42:18.677
emissions. But I'm very proud to
say that public transit makes up

02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:22.790
less than half a percent of

02:42:25.552 --> 02:42:28.320
those emissions. Within the
transport sector. Our biggest

02:42:29.589 --> 02:42:31.589
challenge is private vehicles,

02:42:31.691 --> 02:42:33.691
private cars and trucks, which

02:42:34.327 --> 02:42:37.620
is why all of the work we do
around making transit and

02:42:39.332 --> 02:42:41.332
walking and rolling and biking

02:42:43.337 --> 02:42:45.337
attractive. So important it by

02:42:46.207 --> 02:42:48.408
contrast, you can't even see
muni on the graph and that is

02:42:54.147 --> 02:42:56.147
because we make up less than

02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:58.550
0.0001% of the gas emissions.

02:42:59.190 --> 02:43:01.955
Not only is the majority of our
fleet electric, but the hybrids

02:43:02.556 --> 02:43:04.556
that we operate are operated

02:43:05.250 --> 02:43:07.250
using renewable diesel and our

02:43:11.310 --> 02:43:13.899
fossil fuel free. The reason I
started with this is to make

02:43:14.835 --> 02:43:17.803
sure that as we think about
these important goals around

02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:21.600
zero emissions vehicles, that we

02:43:21.275 --> 02:43:23.275
also continue to recognize that

02:43:25.346 --> 02:43:27.346
the best way to reduce emissions

02:43:28.249 --> 02:43:30.249
is by improving modal share is

02:43:31.885 --> 02:43:33.885
by tackling that that difficult

02:43:34.721 --> 02:43:36.721
30, as you saw, we had the honor

02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:40.260
of hosting the uitp trolley

02:43:40.940 --> 02:43:42.940
commission a couple of weeks ago

02:43:43.964 --> 02:43:46.833
and the secretary general,
basically the head of uitp said

02:43:48.703 --> 02:43:50.703
something that really stuck with

02:43:51.405 --> 02:43:53.405
me, which is I would rather have

02:43:53.775 --> 02:43:56.377
a diesel bus and a transit lane
than an electric bus stuck in

02:43:58.213 --> 02:44:00.447
traffic and I that really
resonated with me because

02:44:04.119 --> 02:44:06.820
getting to a fleet that is zero
emission is important. But

02:44:08.122 --> 02:44:10.122
supporting that fleet with

02:44:11.927 --> 02:44:14.795
protected transit lanes and with
a safe and clean bus shelters

02:44:16.732 --> 02:44:19.333
and all of the other things that
we are doing to improve service

02:44:24.739 --> 02:44:26.739
quality is critical. I

02:44:27.776 --> 02:44:29.776
introduced this framing because

02:44:29.779 --> 02:44:32.460
one of the things I am going to
be signaling today is that we do

02:44:32.247 --> 02:44:35.830
think we need to continue to
purchase hybrid busses as part

02:44:36.218 --> 02:44:38.218
of our overall fleet program and

02:44:39.855 --> 02:44:42.556
that is explicitly to continue
to support those modal share

02:44:43.692 --> 02:44:46.595
goals. If we are not able to
continue to buy a combination

02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:49.330
version of electric and hybrid

02:44:49.432 --> 02:44:52.267
vehicles, we will be forced to
keep our vehicles past their

02:44:53.535 --> 02:44:56.437
useful life and we will lose
some of the transformative

02:44:57.706 --> 02:45:00.608
nature that we've seen in our
fleet program. Our fleet program

02:45:03.713 --> 02:45:05.847
is really it's really principles
based and it's something I'm so

02:45:06.416 --> 02:45:08.683
proud that our maintenance and
our engineering staff have

02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:14.856
embraced. We started by saying
that we were going to design a

02:45:15.825 --> 02:45:17.825
performance based specification

02:45:18.861 --> 02:45:20.662
and what that means is we are
not telling the bus

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.335
manufacturers how to build a bus
or where to put their engine,

02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:29.938
what kind of door to design. We
are telling them that we need

02:45:30.706 --> 02:45:32.706
vehicles that do not break down

02:45:33.609 --> 02:45:35.777
and can be maintained easily and
that they stand behind in terms

02:45:37.113 --> 02:45:39.348
of warranty and they're helping
us to build the best vehicle

02:45:41.385 --> 02:45:43.519
that they can build. We've then
committed to make sure that we

02:45:44.321 --> 02:45:46.755
are maintaining, bring it to the
highest standard. And that

02:45:47.557 --> 02:45:50.492
really means meeting and
oftentimes using data to exceed

02:45:51.461 --> 02:45:54.229
what the manufacturer owners are
recommending. So that we are

02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:57.867
fixing components on busses
before they break, not waiting

02:46:01.404 --> 02:46:04.106
for them to break the last kind
of key piece of this program is

02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:07.710
that we keep these vehicles in a
state of good repair, which

02:46:08.444 --> 02:46:10.444
means not keeping vehicles past

02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:12.580
their useful life and continuing

02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:15.250
to replace them on an ad needed

02:46:19.223 --> 02:46:21.223
basis. Our progress towards zero

02:46:21.492 --> 02:46:24.460
emissions has been mighty. As I
said, we are fortunate that all

02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:27.429
of our trolley busses, our

02:46:28.432 --> 02:46:30.499
trains, our beloved cable car
and historic vehicles are

02:46:33.471 --> 02:46:36.390
powered by clean hydropower from
the hetch hetchy dam. And our

02:46:36.207 --> 02:46:38.207
hybrids, which we were an early

02:46:38.542 --> 02:46:40.542
adopter of in 2007 and now

02:46:42.379 --> 02:46:44.379
represent our full diesel fleet,

02:46:44.581 --> 02:46:46.581
run on renewable diesel. We've

02:46:46.750 --> 02:46:49.553
also, as the technology for
hybrid busses, has advanced,

02:46:50.388 --> 02:46:53.323
we've really taken advantage of
it. The last 68 vehicles that we

02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:58.360
purchased, for example, can be.

02:46:58.496 --> 02:47:00.263
Completely zero emissions
through about 25% of their

02:47:03.167 --> 02:47:05.134
route. So we have used a
partnership with the

02:47:07.872 --> 02:47:10.441
manufacturer and gps coordinates
to make sure that these busses

02:47:11.709 --> 02:47:13.709
are running completely battery

02:47:13.712 --> 02:47:15.712
through some of the neighborhood

02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:18.416
roads like chinatown and the
tenderloin that are experien

02:47:18.416 --> 02:47:20.416
facing a disproportionate

02:47:20.585 --> 02:47:22.585
portion of that vehicle.

02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:25.210
Emissions that I talked about

02:47:27.726 --> 02:47:29.726
earlier. We are also now

02:47:30.610 --> 02:47:32.610
successfully piloting electric

02:47:34.132 --> 02:47:36.533
busses. We now have ten busses,
soon to be 12 from four

02:47:37.768 --> 02:47:39.768
different manufacturers, us and

02:47:40.406 --> 02:47:43.274
the pilot is teaching us a lot.
The first thing that it's

02:47:43.976 --> 02:47:45.976
teaching us is that these busses

02:47:46.311 --> 02:47:48.311
really can handle san francisco

02:47:48.347 --> 02:47:50.347
conditions. It can handle our

02:47:50.615 --> 02:47:52.615
terrain, it can handle all our

02:47:53.985 --> 02:47:55.985
our heavy passenger loads. We're

02:47:56.755 --> 02:47:58.890
testing them all over the city.
So everybody is benefiting from

02:48:00.593 --> 02:48:02.694
them. And we've put these big
lightning bolts on them. So

02:48:03.929 --> 02:48:06.864
people know that they're they're
part of our experiment. We are

02:48:08.667 --> 02:48:10.667
also not seeing the reliability

02:48:11.169 --> 02:48:13.271
yet on these vehicles that we
are seeing on our hybrid fleet.

02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:16.942
And we are currently working to
hold these different

02:48:17.977 --> 02:48:19.977
manufacturers accountable, all

02:48:20.213 --> 02:48:22.214
to improve the quality of their
product, to meet the

02:48:22.648 --> 02:48:24.648
expectations lines of our

02:48:27.753 --> 02:48:30.588
customers. We have also learned
a tremendous amount about the

02:48:31.623 --> 02:48:33.625
facilities and the facility work
is absolutely the most

02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:36.160
challenging thing. Pieces of

02:48:37.330 --> 02:48:39.330
this we have now 12 plug in

02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:43.635
chargers at our woods division
and we are so grateful that we

02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:46.270
have received a large federal

02:48:46.806 --> 02:48:48.873
grant that will allow us to add
an additional 12 chargers

02:48:49.642 --> 02:48:51.642
chargers that have the overhead

02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:55.881
pantograph, which is a much
easier way to charge the

02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.180
vehicles, along with. Six sps

02:49:01.354 --> 02:49:03.255
lots at a creek that will allow
us to pilot 60 foot electric

02:49:05.258 --> 02:49:07.258
vehicles, which we're also very

02:49:09.596 --> 02:49:12.531
anxious to test everything we do
in the fleet world because of

02:49:13.967 --> 02:49:15.967
electric location is now

02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:18.360
inextricably linked to our

02:49:19.539 --> 02:49:22.241
facility program. And these two
teams and these kind of two

02:49:23.109 --> 02:49:25.109
worlds have worked together to

02:49:25.379 --> 02:49:27.379
create a really a living plan

02:49:29.583 --> 02:49:31.583
and a living approach. When we

02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:36.550
adopted the 2018 policy, we it
was very restrictive. It

02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:40.793
eliminated all busses except for
battery electric, and that

02:49:41.695 --> 02:49:43.695
included the trolley busses. And

02:49:43.831 --> 02:49:46.700
as a result, the potrero
facility, which is going to be
our first new facility

02:49:47.601 --> 02:49:49.601
investment, was anticipating

02:49:50.938 --> 02:49:53.172
kind of short term trolley, but
then really a transition to

02:49:54.207 --> 02:49:56.609
electrification in we are now
strongly recommending based on

02:49:59.313 --> 02:50:02.480
what we've learned in the last 6
or 7 years that the agency stay

02:50:03.184 --> 02:50:05.852
vested in trolleys, which means
that potrero would become really

02:50:08.689 --> 02:50:10.689
the trolley hub of the of the

02:50:10.925 --> 02:50:12.925
agency. It has expanded in space

02:50:13.761 --> 02:50:16.296
in it and would allow us to move
the majority of our trolley

02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:18.830
vehicles to this central

02:50:21.102 --> 02:50:23.102
location. The zero emissions

02:50:24.305 --> 02:50:26.305
policy, which the board adopted

02:50:29.377 --> 02:50:31.377
in 2018, called for us to be

02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:34.880
100% zero emissions by 2035 and

02:50:35.284 --> 02:50:37.284
to not buy anything but battery

02:50:39.621 --> 02:50:41.621
electric busses by 2025. I am

02:50:42.123 --> 02:50:44.123
here today to ask you to modify

02:50:46.327 --> 02:50:48.328
that policy because it is not
achievable or it's really only

02:50:49.464 --> 02:50:52.165
achievable if we don't buy new
busses, which I believe will

02:50:54.769 --> 02:50:56.769
degrade our transit experience.

02:50:57.239 --> 02:50:59.807
We adopted our policy about nine
months ahead of the california

02:51:02.744 --> 02:51:04.744
air resources board and which

02:51:04.879 --> 02:51:06.879
has adopted a slightly more

02:51:09.517 --> 02:51:11.517
relaxed goal of 2040 and the

02:51:13.389 --> 02:51:15.757
carb program does also allow for
exemptions based on some of the

02:51:15.991 --> 02:51:18.426
challenges we're seeing,
particularly around funding and

02:51:21.363 --> 02:51:24.980
utility coordination. So our
main recommendation today is

02:51:25.767 --> 02:51:27.767
that we modify the policy to be

02:51:27.804 --> 02:51:29.804
more expansive, to allow all

02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:32.390
zero emissions vehicles,

02:51:32.274 --> 02:51:34.274
including trolleys as well as to

02:51:34.443 --> 02:51:36.443
align our time line with the

02:51:36.645 --> 02:51:38.645
california air resources board

02:51:47.924 --> 02:51:50.726
timeline. As I indicate. Did I
think the biggest hurdle in

02:51:51.494 --> 02:51:53.494
front of us is funding

02:51:53.996 --> 02:51:55.996
jonathan's team is estimating

02:51:56.165 --> 02:51:58.166
that just the electrification
portions of the building

02:52:00.903 --> 02:52:02.903
progress program are upwards of

02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:05.740
$1.3 billion. We also are seeing

02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:09.100
about a 30% premium between

02:52:09.345 --> 02:52:11.345
hybrids and electric vehicles.

02:52:13.383 --> 02:52:15.984
So that in and of itself is also
another about a quarter of $1

02:52:18.487 --> 02:52:21.290
billion. So this is this is a
lot of money. It's a lot of

02:52:23.126 --> 02:52:25.461
need. And we have frankly had a
mixed record, which is not

02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:29.531
unique to california. Yeah, I
had an opportunity this morning

02:52:32.135 --> 02:52:34.135
to speak at a conference about

02:52:34.570 --> 02:52:36.570
the us transition to clean

02:52:37.608 --> 02:52:40.276
busses and there was a southern
california property de octa

02:52:42.813 --> 02:52:44.981
there. And one of the things
they pointed out is that because

02:52:45.549 --> 02:52:47.884
california was such a leader in
early adoption of low emissions,

02:52:50.587 --> 02:52:52.587
we are not receiving federal

02:52:52.689 --> 02:52:55.490
kind of credit when we compete
for these grants because we are

02:52:56.527 --> 02:52:58.527
not seeing dry dramatic drops in

02:52:59.296 --> 02:53:01.296
emissions because as I showed

02:53:04.101 --> 02:53:06.101
you, we're at 0.001. But by not

02:53:06.804 --> 02:53:09.380
helping us with this journey and
with this regulatory

02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:12.975
requirement, it's almost rewards
the states that didn't make the

02:53:12.977 --> 02:53:14.977
same investment that california

02:53:19.617 --> 02:53:21.617
made in low emissions. So the

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:24.620
main the main pivot that I'm

02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:27.990
asking is that we continue on an

02:53:28.259 --> 02:53:30.259
ambitious journey towards zero

02:53:32.970 --> 02:53:34.970
emissions. But that our vehicles

02:53:36.934 --> 02:53:38.934
track with our facility capacity

02:53:39.871 --> 02:53:41.871
. This is the program jonathan

02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:44.640
is here to answer all your hard

02:53:45.876 --> 02:53:47.876
questions about it. But it does

02:53:49.881 --> 02:53:52.616
start out with the two pilots. I
talked about. We are then

02:53:53.451 --> 02:53:55.352
working towards the kirkland
yard being our first fully

02:53:58.489 --> 02:54:00.489
electric facility. The benefits

02:54:01.859 --> 02:54:03.859
of starting with kirkland is it

02:54:03.928 --> 02:54:05.928
is an open air facility. It is

02:54:06.598 --> 02:54:09.133
relatively straightforward in
terms of the construction

02:54:11.503 --> 02:54:14.271
process, but it is an unfunded
construction project. So we have

02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:17.240
been moving as much money as we

02:54:17.242 --> 02:54:19.242
can to keep the design going

02:54:19.311 --> 02:54:21.311
because as we very much want to

02:54:21.346 --> 02:54:23.346
open up this facility in 2028,

02:54:23.649 --> 02:54:25.649
we also believe that as the

02:54:26.118 --> 02:54:28.486
project matures, it will become
more competitive of for

02:54:30.522 --> 02:54:32.522
discretionary funding. The

02:54:32.691 --> 02:54:34.691
second, all electric facility

02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:37.928
would be a slave creek, but we
don't currently see a pathway to

02:54:37.929 --> 02:54:39.929
complete that project before

02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:43.168
2030, which is why we are
anticipating not just the

02:54:44.103 --> 02:54:46.103
upcoming procurement to have

02:54:46.772 --> 02:54:49.173
some hybrid vehicles in it, but
also the subsequent procurements

02:54:50.276 --> 02:54:52.276
through the end of the decade

02:54:55.114 --> 02:54:57.114
and in terms of next steps for

02:55:00.587 --> 02:55:02.954
this work, we if the board
signals and makes the policy

02:55:04.256 --> 02:55:06.256
change today, we would very much

02:55:07.893 --> 02:55:09.893
like to designate potrero as the

02:55:11.864 --> 02:55:13.864
trolley hub. We are recommending

02:55:16.503 --> 02:55:18.604
that we temporarily store the 60
foot trolleys while we do the

02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:21.874
potrero construction. We had
previously talked about building

02:55:24.430 --> 02:55:26.430
some very expensive temporary

02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:29.147
facilities and with our 2018
vehicle demands, that would have

02:55:30.816 --> 02:55:32.816
been absolutely necessary. But

02:55:32.819 --> 02:55:34.819
but as I said, because this is a

02:55:35.550 --> 02:55:37.550
living document, because we

02:55:37.557 --> 02:55:39.525
understand now that our short
term vehicle demand is

02:55:41.861 --> 02:55:44.263
relatively short, we can an
approach it in this more cost

02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:49.768
effective way. We also would
like to continue to pursue a

02:55:50.905 --> 02:55:52.905
combination of procuring hybrids

02:55:54.508 --> 02:55:56.508
and electric vehicles. The

02:55:57.711 --> 02:55:59.711
action before you today would be

02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:01.880
to revise is the zero emission

02:56:02.249 --> 02:56:04.249
policy and then we would be

02:56:04.884 --> 02:56:06.884
bringing you later this year or

02:56:07.788 --> 02:56:09.788
early next year a procurement

02:56:11.158 --> 02:56:13.158
for our replacement vehicles

02:56:14.595 --> 02:56:16.595
initially with new flier to by

02:56:19.900 --> 02:56:21.900
94 hybrid vehicles. As 7 in 40

02:56:22.169 --> 02:56:24.169
foot electric vehicles and then

02:56:24.404 --> 02:56:26.404
the six 60 foot trolley vehicles

02:56:26.474 --> 02:56:28.474
. And then I'm also very excited

02:56:30.611 --> 02:56:33.480
that gillig, which is a bay area
based bus manufacturer and has

02:56:35.149 --> 02:56:37.149
not been interested in the past

02:56:37.751 --> 02:56:39.753
in selling sfmta busses, has
been really excited about how

02:56:39.753 --> 02:56:41.753
we're approaching our

02:56:42.757 --> 02:56:45.920
maintenance work, how we are
striving towards partnerships

02:56:46.861 --> 02:56:48.861
with the private sector. And so

02:56:50.798 --> 02:56:53.433
they have also agreed to build.
Five 40 foot trolley busses as

02:56:56.170 --> 02:56:58.170
and then lastly, I want to flag

02:56:58.172 --> 02:57:00.172
that we do anticipate needing to

02:57:01.976 --> 02:57:03.976
come to you in 2024 for to

02:57:05.146 --> 02:57:07.146
approve an exemption to the to

02:57:08.883 --> 02:57:10.883
the carb policy in order to have

02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:20.600
this mixed procurement approach.

02:57:21.864 --> 02:57:23.864
This graph here, I think tracks

02:57:26.368 --> 02:57:29.270
our transition. We would be.
Targeting 2040, which is about

02:57:29.437 --> 02:57:32.406
how long we think that the
facility program is going to

02:57:32.841 --> 02:57:34.841
take in order to support this

02:57:37.813 --> 02:57:39.813
work, but also continuing to be

02:57:41.183 --> 02:57:43.183
nimble and make changes in real

02:57:44.319 --> 02:57:46.954
time if things start to be more
complicated than we're currently

02:57:50.825 --> 02:57:53.161
expecting. And the last topic
that I want to talk about before

02:57:55.464 --> 02:57:57.532
I wrap up is that we are very
committed to having a just

02:57:59.501 --> 02:58:01.501
transition for our workers and

02:58:01.871 --> 02:58:04.672
really make sure that this board
knows that this work will not

02:58:06.141 --> 02:58:08.141
result in any job loss for our

02:58:08.610 --> 02:58:10.610
our current amazing maintenance

02:58:11.981 --> 02:58:13.981
staff. We are very, very

02:58:14.951 --> 02:58:17.252
fortunate that the we took the
hybrid approach to this

02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:20.454
transition because the vehicles

02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:23.657
are so similar. Our we have been

02:58:24.326 --> 02:58:26.327
able to train our automotive
mechanics that maintain the

02:58:28.365 --> 02:58:30.365
hybrid vehicles to maintain the

02:58:30.533 --> 02:58:33.202
pilot busses with really no more
additional training than what

02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:36.700
they would receive with any new

02:58:37.139 --> 02:58:39.139
bus. We also are so fortunate

02:58:42.278 --> 02:58:44.278
that we have a traction power.

02:58:45.615 --> 02:58:47.850
The staff already working on the
trolley vehicles that would

02:58:49.853 --> 02:58:51.887
expand their scope to support
the electric location of our

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:55.690
facilities. So we do not have

02:58:56.459 --> 02:58:58.459
some of the complicated job

02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:01.196
training and transition needs
that the rest of the industry

02:59:02.232 --> 02:59:04.232
has. But we are also

02:59:04.701 --> 02:59:07.570
continuously tracking this work
and making sure our staff

02:59:08.405 --> 02:59:10.539
understand that we remain vested
in them as we make this

02:59:14.346 --> 02:59:17.279
transition an I think that i
have made the mistake in the

02:59:17.681 --> 02:59:20.282
past when we've talked to
different policy groups about

02:59:21.719 --> 02:59:23.719
electrification to be overly

02:59:24.822 --> 02:59:26.822
rosy. This is the last hybrids

02:59:27.157 --> 02:59:29.826
will bring you or this is the
last, last hybrids that will

02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:33.229
bring you. I'm trying to take a
different tone today, which is

02:59:34.164 --> 02:59:37.330
to say in many ways, I think the
plan that we have laid out for

02:59:38.350 --> 02:59:40.350
you is the best case scenario.

02:59:40.738 --> 02:59:42.738
It assumes funding that we still

02:59:42.940 --> 02:59:44.940
do not have in hand. It includes

02:59:46.744 --> 02:59:48.744
coordination with a regional

02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:51.714
utility provider that is trying
to scale up not just for san

02:59:51.782 --> 02:59:53.782
francisco and not just for

02:59:54.552 --> 02:59:56.552
transit, but across multiple

02:59:59.230 --> 03:00:01.230
sectors as many, many parts of

03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:05.729
the city are moving towards zero
electrification. So we are

03:00:08.766 --> 03:00:10.766
trying to manage those risks by

03:00:12.304 --> 03:00:14.304
doing this planning, by working

03:00:15.740 --> 03:00:17.740
with pga on what our big need is

03:00:18.943 --> 03:00:20.943
as well as the specific projects

03:00:21.145 --> 03:00:23.145
that we are looking all over the

03:00:24.983 --> 03:00:26.950
country to try to understand how
the different properties are

03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:30.920
approaching this and what we can

03:00:36.628 --> 03:00:39.363
learn. We have been doing a lot
of outreach on this because it's

03:00:40.665 --> 03:00:43.534
not necessarily intuitive. You
know, how does continuing to buy

03:00:45.436 --> 03:00:47.436
hybrids or easing up on our

03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:50.440
policy help with emissions and

03:00:50.709 --> 03:00:53.377
taking the time I think to
explain the connection between

03:00:55.814 --> 03:00:57.814
mode share and also some of the

03:00:58.216 --> 03:01:00.216
challenges with facility

03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:03.120
electrification I think has been
time really well spent. And

03:01:03.755 --> 03:01:05.755
we're really proud that we've

03:01:05.958 --> 03:01:07.958
received several letters of

03:01:08.728 --> 03:01:10.728
support for this policy change

03:01:11.464 --> 03:01:14.332
from groups that are year or two
ago really didn't even want to

03:01:15.434 --> 03:01:17.434
entertain the idea of a policy

03:01:18.804 --> 03:01:21.105
change. And I think there's a
general interest in particularly

03:01:21.941 --> 03:01:23.941
the environmental advocacy

03:01:24.644 --> 03:01:27.450
community, to want to make sure
that we continue anew, to charge

03:01:29.549 --> 03:01:32.417
ahead as quickly as we can, but
also a recognition that we need

03:01:33.986 --> 03:01:36.387
to do so in a way that is
practical and fundable and does

03:01:37.389 --> 03:01:39.389
not compromise our current

03:01:41.161 --> 03:01:43.996
service. I'm also grateful for
our close partnership with the

03:01:44.798 --> 03:01:46.798
department of the environment on

03:01:46.966 --> 03:01:49.801
this work and really thinking
through how this fits into the

03:01:51.404 --> 03:01:54.306
city's overall climate action
plan, which ultimately is our

03:01:58.812 --> 03:02:00.812
guiding document. So the today's

03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:05.830
action before you is to amend

03:02:05.151 --> 03:02:07.151
the zero emission policy. It is

03:02:07.921 --> 03:02:09.988
to align it with the california
air resources board, which is

03:02:12.425 --> 03:02:14.425
currently targeting 2040. It

03:02:14.461 --> 03:02:16.461
also would allow us to continue

03:02:18.232 --> 03:02:20.232
to invest in in all forms of

03:02:20.534 --> 03:02:23.269
zero emissions vehicles, which
allows us the flexibility to

03:02:24.671 --> 03:02:26.671
make decision plans based on

03:02:26.706 --> 03:02:28.706
different facility constraints

03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:36.810
and also to learn over time and.

03:02:37.217 --> 03:02:39.852
To really integrate zero zero
electrification in vehicles into

03:02:41.210 --> 03:02:43.210
our overall climate change

03:02:44.558 --> 03:02:46.658
approach and make sure that we
are driving forward in a way

03:02:48.628 --> 03:02:50.628
that is complementary to our

03:02:50.731 --> 03:02:52.731
ultimate mode. Shift goals and

03:02:54.701 --> 03:02:56.701
doesn't contradict it or put it

03:02:58.572 --> 03:03:01.308
at tension. Thank you. Thank
you. Directors, are there
questions for director

03:03:01.308 --> 03:03:03.308
kirschbaum before we go to

03:03:04.144 --> 03:03:06.144
public comment? Director

03:03:07.682 --> 03:03:09.716
heminger. Thank you, MADAM Chair
. Julie, I actually had a

03:03:10.351 --> 03:03:12.351
question about the slide. You

03:03:13.554 --> 03:03:15.554
didn't show on the trolley

03:03:16.257 --> 03:03:18.257
expansion. Is there a way to

03:03:21.950 --> 03:03:23.963
bring that up? There it is. And
maybe you could just help me

03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:27.901
reconcile. You know, we were
sort of full of praises for the

03:03:28.470 --> 03:03:31.304
trolley earlier in the meeting,
and this is considerably more

03:03:36.477 --> 03:03:38.612
negative. Um, so I believe I
don't know whether this is a

03:03:40.748 --> 03:03:43.384
response in part to the proposal
that we saw from the electrical

03:03:46.354 --> 03:03:48.354
workers. But I do want to ask

03:03:48.490 --> 03:03:50.490
the question anew. Why not

03:03:51.659 --> 03:03:54.495
instead of what? What did jeff
say? Hauling those two tons of

03:03:55.463 --> 03:03:57.463
batteries up and down our hills?

03:03:57.932 --> 03:03:59.932
Why not expand the trolley

03:04:01.236 --> 03:04:04.138
network and achieve the same
purpose? Thank you for that

03:04:05.507 --> 03:04:08.442
question. I my apologies that
this slide came off as negative

03:04:09.645 --> 03:04:11.645
because we are very enthusiastic

03:04:12.647 --> 03:04:14.982
about trolleys and in particular
we are enthused about the

03:04:15.917 --> 03:04:17.917
evolution of trolleys which

03:04:19.688 --> 03:04:21.688
include in motion charging. We

03:04:22.525 --> 03:04:24.525
are currently testing it on four

03:04:26.562 --> 03:04:28.562
of our vehicles and will be able

03:04:28.764 --> 03:04:30.764
to expand it to the entire

03:04:31.667 --> 03:04:33.901
almost 300 vehicle trolley fleet
. What it does is it allows us

03:04:36.105 --> 03:04:38.105
to go 5 to 10 miles off wire and

03:04:39.442 --> 03:04:42.310
then recharge within about 45
minutes. So it has a lot of

03:04:44.513 --> 03:04:46.513
advantages and we very much

03:04:46.649 --> 03:04:48.649
believe that trolleys are an

03:04:48.851 --> 03:04:51.652
important part of our zero
emission future. And that we

03:04:52.655 --> 03:04:55.491
should continue to invest in
future generations of trolley

03:05:00.262 --> 03:05:02.263
vehicles. We are are cautiously
optimistic that the biggest

03:05:04.433 --> 03:05:06.433
hurdle that we faced in 2018 we

03:05:06.502 --> 03:05:08.502
MAY be able to address, which is

03:05:08.971 --> 03:05:11.540
we cannot stay vested in trolley
vehicles if there isn't a

03:05:12.976 --> 03:05:15.778
trolley bus to buy. And when we
bought the current vehicles us,

03:05:15.979 --> 03:05:17.979
there was one manufacturer, new

03:05:21.551 --> 03:05:23.551
flier. They only agreed. To

03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:26.870
design a trolley bus because as

03:05:26.890 --> 03:05:29.358
we join seattle so we really had
buying power and they said don't

03:05:30.894 --> 03:05:32.894
don't get used to it. This is

03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:36.532
this is the last one in under
jeff's leadership, bob and

03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:39.500
gayatri, who is here, pulled

03:05:40.703 --> 03:05:43.438
together a trolley consortium of
five north american agencies to

03:05:44.942 --> 03:05:46.942
signal to the manufacturer, hey,

03:05:47.611 --> 03:05:49.611
we're we're going to continue to

03:05:50.130 --> 03:05:52.248
stay vested in trolleys and even
if you're not too interested in

03:05:54.418 --> 03:05:56.852
any one of us collectively, we
start to have some some decent

03:05:57.854 --> 03:05:59.854
numbers. Nothing compared to

03:06:00.223 --> 03:06:02.223
diesel or electric busses, but

03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:05.495
still something that is can be
cost effective. It's been very

03:06:06.997 --> 03:06:09.866
successful. And one of the
things that we were most excited

03:06:10.301 --> 03:06:12.835
about during the trolley
conference was solaris, a

03:06:15.873 --> 03:06:17.873
european bus manufacturer attend

03:06:18.141 --> 03:06:21.110
ing and signaling that they will
be entering the us bus market.

03:06:22.246 --> 03:06:24.848
It to not only build battery
electric busses, but to also

03:06:26.170 --> 03:06:28.584
build trolley busses and bring
all of that european trolley

03:06:31.455 --> 03:06:33.455
experience to san francisco in

03:06:33.524 --> 03:06:35.524
in the short term trolley

03:06:36.661 --> 03:06:38.661
expansion has all of the same

03:06:39.798 --> 03:06:41.798
challenges as the battery

03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.801
electric do because we currently
only have two trolley facilities

03:06:46.838 --> 03:06:48.838
and we're about to close one of

03:06:50.410 --> 03:06:51.875
them for a 3 to 4 year
construction period. We also

03:06:55.146 --> 03:06:57.146
have a really aging ing

03:06:59.317 --> 03:07:02.286
infrastructure, so I'm hesitant
to build new wires and new

03:07:05.366 --> 03:07:07.124
substations when we have
substations that are 50 years
old and very badly need to be

03:07:07.459 --> 03:07:09.860
replaced. But what's exciting
about the inmotion charging is

03:07:12.998 --> 03:07:14.998
we don't necessarily need to

03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:17.168
paper over the city with new
wires. We can really take

03:07:17.202 --> 03:07:19.202
advantage of corridors that

03:07:19.671 --> 03:07:21.671
already have a portion of wires.

03:07:22.307 --> 03:07:24.942
So for example, a corridor like
the seven eight, which has

03:07:26.511 --> 03:07:28.511
overhead wires on haight street

03:07:29.448 --> 03:07:31.448
and market street but doesn't

03:07:31.617 --> 03:07:33.617
have them in the sunset, could

03:07:33.619 --> 03:07:35.619
become a trolley route. So we

03:07:36.788 --> 03:07:38.788
very much do think that trolleys

03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:41.240
are part of the future. They MAY

03:07:42.961 --> 03:07:44.961
even be part of our expansion

03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:47.630
past 2030, but they don't have

03:07:47.166 --> 03:07:49.166
any immediate expansion

03:07:49.502 --> 03:07:51.502
capability because of our

03:07:51.737 --> 03:07:54.606
facility constraints. But that's
something that over over a

03:07:55.841 --> 03:07:57.841
relatively short time will be

03:07:57.843 --> 03:07:59.843
remedied, right? Absolutely

03:07:59.912 --> 03:08:02.780
okay. Well, I'm glad I asked the
question because you sound more

03:08:03.515 --> 03:08:05.515
positive than your words, at

03:08:07.654 --> 03:08:09.654
least as I read them at. And

03:08:09.822 --> 03:08:11.890
carb is on board with this. I
mean, they've reached the point

03:08:12.925 --> 03:08:14.925
where they're they're willing to

03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:19.730
say that a trolley powered by

03:08:20.933 --> 03:08:23.903
hydro up in the sierra is zero
emission. Yes, they are. Okay,

03:08:24.938 --> 03:08:26.938
well, that's good. That's

03:08:27.173 --> 03:08:29.173
progress. I certainly support

03:08:29.275 --> 03:08:32.770
the policy change as you're
proposing today. I think we

03:08:33.846 --> 03:08:35.846
probably as a city jump the gun

03:08:36.749 --> 03:08:38.749
a little bit before we needed to

03:08:38.784 --> 03:08:41.487
and now have to backtrack a bit.
I think carb has woken up and

03:08:42.589 --> 03:08:44.589
smelled the coffee and I very

03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:48.894
much appreciate the comments
text you gave us at the

03:08:49.195 --> 03:08:51.930
beginning, because what what
we're doing here is chasing a

03:08:52.699 --> 03:08:54.699
vanishingly small source of

03:08:56.537 --> 03:08:59.338
emissions means if you want a
big source of emissions, go talk

03:08:59.406 --> 03:09:01.406
to the commercial trucking

03:09:02.376 --> 03:09:05.144
industry. And I recall when we
got involved with carb on this

03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:08.680
as a region, we said, couldn't

03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:11.820
you go pick on somebody your own

03:09:12.152 --> 03:09:14.286
size because public transit is
worried about just opening the

03:09:18.192 --> 03:09:21.940
doors every morning. But look,
they're on the search of all the

03:09:21.762 --> 03:09:23.762
emissions, not just the small

03:09:25.132 --> 03:09:27.132
ones and the big ones. So i

03:09:27.267 --> 03:09:29.267
appreciate the fact that they're

03:09:29.303 --> 03:09:31.303
, I think, making a reasonable

03:09:31.306 --> 03:09:33.306
course correction and that we

03:09:34.909 --> 03:09:36.909
are to thank you, great other

03:09:42.383 --> 03:09:44.918
colleagues, directors so. Thank
you for the presentation then I

03:09:47.521 --> 03:09:49.522
would like to I'm looking at the
slide with all the

03:09:50.458 --> 03:09:52.759
electrification on the of our
properties and what you

03:09:57.565 --> 03:09:59.565
mentioned was that only maybe 1

03:10:00.635 --> 03:10:02.635
or 2, it's I think it's this

03:10:02.770 --> 03:10:04.770
one, only 1 or 2 are funded. And

03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:07.840
so, so it's like I'd like to

03:10:09.211 --> 03:10:11.211
hear a little bit more about how

03:10:11.279 --> 03:10:13.279
if it's even, what is the

03:10:13.515 --> 03:10:15.515
likelihood of like these there's

03:10:17.385 --> 03:10:19.385
the right bus for us to buy and

03:10:19.754 --> 03:10:21.754
we have the money and already

03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:24.892
build these facilities to
migrate them to electrification

03:10:27.529 --> 03:10:29.529
means that these busses needs.

03:10:29.698 --> 03:10:31.698
Um, I think that's something we

03:10:32.234 --> 03:10:34.234
are going to learn more over

03:10:35.937 --> 03:10:37.937
time. We are are going after

03:10:38.730 --> 03:10:40.730
every grant opportunity city. We

03:10:41.343 --> 03:10:43.343
did face a pretty significant

03:10:44.713 --> 03:10:47.582
setback with the geo bond. That
would have been a major infusion

03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:50.500
of resources for our facility

03:10:51.954 --> 03:10:53.954
program which is just in general

03:10:56.591 --> 03:10:59.260
a hard program to fund. So I, I
don't know that I have a sense

03:11:02.598 --> 03:11:05.333
of what our odds are in terms of
funding. We are leaving no stone

03:11:06.235 --> 03:11:08.235
unturned. We are going after

03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:12.720
every every source available to

03:11:18.214 --> 03:11:20.182
us. Okay well, thank you. So
director hensey, any further

03:11:21.984 --> 03:11:23.984
questions? No questions. I'll

03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:26.320
just say I'm in alignment with

03:11:26.622 --> 03:11:29.491
director hemminger on this very
part of the item. I. I

03:11:32.728 --> 03:11:34.728
understand the previous board,

03:11:35.131 --> 03:11:37.131
um, or attempting to be leaders

03:11:37.534 --> 03:11:40.335
in this area. And I think we are
and I think we as an agency, we

03:11:44.307 --> 03:11:46.307
are a leader in green bus

03:11:47.977 --> 03:11:50.745
transportation. We um, and I
think we should keep that as our

03:11:53.717 --> 03:11:55.717
goal and, and fortunately by the

03:11:55.719 --> 03:11:57.719
time I outlined in the current

03:11:57.854 --> 03:11:59.854
policy before today's action, I

03:12:01.124 --> 03:12:03.124
just don't see a path forward in

03:12:05.610 --> 03:12:07.610
getting the facilities that we

03:12:08.999 --> 03:12:10.999
need for, for the zero emission

03:12:12.136 --> 03:12:14.136
vehicles by the time outlined in

03:12:16.473 --> 03:12:18.473
the current policy. So again,

03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:21.900
very supportive and appreciative

03:12:21.478 --> 03:12:23.345
of staff bringing this forward.
I think it's a practical

03:12:27.951 --> 03:12:29.951
approach. To do this. Um issue.

03:12:32.222 --> 03:12:34.390
So thank you. And, and after
public comment, I'll be happy to

03:12:35.459 --> 03:12:37.459
make a motion to approve this

03:12:38.628 --> 03:12:40.628
item. Thank you, director henzi

03:12:40.764 --> 03:12:43.265
I'd like to open it up for
public comment, but for anyone

03:12:45.203 --> 03:12:47.203
in the room on this item 12 at

03:12:47.772 --> 03:12:50.173
this time, actually, chair egan,
I did have department of

03:12:51.275 --> 03:12:54.210
environment staff on the webex
and I believe they did want to

03:12:55.479 --> 03:12:57.479
share some words. Okay. Thank

03:13:03.870 --> 03:13:05.589
you. So tyrone, hi there, it's
leo kai. I'm the deputy director

03:13:07.580 --> 03:13:09.580
for san francisco environment.

03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:11.360
Tyrone wasn't able to make it

03:13:12.163 --> 03:13:14.163
today, but he asked me to attend

03:13:14.465 --> 03:13:16.465
on his behalf. Um, I wanted to

03:13:16.534 --> 03:13:18.534
just affirm that the board item

03:13:18.603 --> 03:13:21.305
that you're hearing does align
with the city's sustainability

03:13:21.540 --> 03:13:23.540
goals and that our department

03:13:23.608 --> 03:13:25.509
supports the plan being put
forward by staff. As quick

03:13:27.545 --> 03:13:29.213
background for the public to san
francisco environment department

03:13:30.314 --> 03:13:32.314
is responsible for coordinating

03:13:32.784 --> 03:13:34.818
the implementation of the 2021
climate action plan, which was

03:13:36.288 --> 03:13:38.856
unanimous unanimously approved
by the san francisco board of

03:13:39.591 --> 03:13:42.360
supervisors and signed by mayor
breed as well. Our goals are

03:13:43.895 --> 03:13:45.596
codified under chapter nine of
the environment code and the

03:13:46.998 --> 03:13:48.998
code calls for net zero emission

03:13:50.368 --> 03:13:52.569
by 2040. So director zhou and I
met with the sfmta team and

03:13:53.238 --> 03:13:55.238
support the plan revisions as

03:13:55.774 --> 03:13:57.774
emphasized during julie's

03:13:58.143 --> 03:14:00.378
presentation, san francisco does
indeed have one of the cleanest

03:14:01.613 --> 03:14:03.614
municipal fleets in the nation
and such a robust public transit

03:14:06.318 --> 03:14:08.252
system. And as we electrify the
transportation and building

03:14:10.288 --> 03:14:13.192
sectors, we do see and I wanted
to confirm that there is indeed

03:14:13.192 --> 03:14:15.192
a statewide challenge of

03:14:15.828 --> 03:14:18.763
improving the electric grid. So
it is really important. We also

03:14:19.698 --> 03:14:22.433
need to ensure that we are
continuing to maximize ridership

03:14:24.690 --> 03:14:26.690
and that requires us to ensure

03:14:26.171 --> 03:14:28.171
operational, reliable city.

03:14:28.173 --> 03:14:31.430
That's the key thing. So the
adjustment proposed in the

03:14:32.450 --> 03:14:34.450
timeline still fits with our

03:14:34.547 --> 03:14:36.547
overarching climate goals of net

03:14:36.782 --> 03:14:38.817
zero emissions by 2040, and it
accounts for changes in the

03:14:39.752 --> 03:14:41.752
landscape around implement and

03:14:42.488 --> 03:14:44.488
funding. So thanks to the mta

03:14:45.570 --> 03:14:47.570
board for letting me speak today

03:14:47.293 --> 03:14:49.328
, thank you for that context.
It's very helpful. Thanks for

03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:53.232
joining us. You're welcome. Uh,
go to public comment now. All

03:14:54.634 --> 03:14:56.634
right. Thank you. Thank you.

03:14:56.736 --> 03:14:58.770
Board members. My name is alex
lansberg, research advocacy

03:14:59.739 --> 03:15:02.308
director for with the san
francisco electric construction

03:15:02.308 --> 03:15:04.308
industry. And pardon me, I've

03:15:04.711 --> 03:15:07.179
been talking way too much today,
so for the past few months I've

03:15:07.414 --> 03:15:09.480
been appearing before you to
speak about the importance of

03:15:10.216 --> 03:15:12.985
leveraging our existing overhead
line network for decarbonizing

03:15:12.986 --> 03:15:14.986
san francisco's transit system.

03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:16.889
So I'm glad to see this
monumental policy change before

03:15:17.457 --> 03:15:19.524
you and want to thank director
tumlin for his leadership in

03:15:20.360 --> 03:15:22.663
bringing it about. While this
represents an important

03:15:22.663 --> 03:15:24.663
turnaround from the plan to

03:15:24.731 --> 03:15:26.565
eliminate that network a few
years ago, there's a lot more

03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:29.300
work to be done simply put,

03:15:29.303 --> 03:15:31.404
electrifying muni quickly and
economically. I mean, we heard

03:15:32.572 --> 03:15:34.607
what a billion and a half
dollars already will require a

03:15:34.741 --> 03:15:36.875
creative approach to integrating
new technology and leveraging

03:15:37.344 --> 03:15:40.280
our existing infrastructure.
What does this mean in practice?

03:15:40.447 --> 03:15:42.447
This number one, no new diesel

03:15:42.449 --> 03:15:44.449
purchases sfmta must first

03:15:44.652 --> 03:15:46.886
analyze how to deploy the dozens
. I think we've got over 100 now

03:15:47.621 --> 03:15:49.989
total of its unused trolley
busses before making a massive

03:15:51.580 --> 03:15:53.359
capital expenditure on diesel to
do, we need to analyze the high

03:15:55.529 --> 03:15:57.530
opportunity trolley bus
deployment opportunities that we

03:15:59.660 --> 03:16:01.901
showed in our map. The 7 to 9
were on there. I think the 38

03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:04.570
needs to be incorporated as part

03:16:04.872 --> 03:16:06.872
of the gary rapid transit

03:16:07.508 --> 03:16:09.642
planning to see what we can do
there and we need to revisit the

03:16:09.843 --> 03:16:11.843
yard redevelopment plans because

03:16:12.179 --> 03:16:14.213
as we can see, they are actually
working against us on these

03:16:15.116 --> 03:16:17.517
things. So thank you for moving
this forward. A couple of

03:16:18.119 --> 03:16:20.887
things. I know I only have like
30s left on specifically around

03:16:21.989 --> 03:16:24.257
the adequacy of the grid. I
think one of the things, one of

03:16:24.492 --> 03:16:26.492
the really important things that

03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:29.940
our study showed is just the

03:16:29.463 --> 03:16:31.463
much, much more robust energy

03:16:31.533 --> 03:16:33.667
management and efficiency of the
trolley bus network. A good

03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:37.670
example is compare bring what

03:16:37.705 --> 03:16:39.705
they're doing in geneva versus

03:16:41.242 --> 03:16:43.242
columbia. Columbia carries one

03:16:43.477 --> 03:16:45.477
line, carries six times as many

03:16:45.913 --> 03:16:48.715
people at half the energy load
compared to another line in

03:16:49.952 --> 03:16:51.952
geneva. So I think that that's

03:16:52.621 --> 03:16:54.688
absolutely critical. The second
the second one is on

03:16:54.823 --> 03:16:56.823
manufacturing capacity. I think

03:16:57.258 --> 03:16:59.258
what we're seeing, I know what

03:16:59.427 --> 03:17:01.795
we're seeing is other agencies
are going to deal with this.

03:17:02.230 --> 03:17:04.230
Let's have the next speaker jump

03:17:09.738 --> 03:17:12.473
in. Okay. Thank you so much.
Chair egan, director tomlin and

03:17:13.875 --> 03:17:16.744
members of the board. My name is
mark sawchuck. I'm a daily muni

03:17:17.813 --> 03:17:20.481
rider and I'm also a member of
the community working group that

03:17:23.318 --> 03:17:26.121
is advising muni on the
reconfiguration of the muni

03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:29.257
metro system. But today we're
here to talk about a different

03:17:29.992 --> 03:17:32.360
form of electric trans
transportation, the trolley bus

03:17:34.290 --> 03:17:36.864
system. I submitted a letter of
support for this agenda item,

03:17:37.699 --> 03:17:39.700
but I feel so strongly about it
I decided I needed to come down

03:17:42.573 --> 03:17:44.773
here as well today for almost 90
years, since 1935, san

03:17:45.674 --> 03:17:47.674
francisco's trolley bus system,

03:17:47.844 --> 03:17:50.645
the most extensive in the united
states, has combined excellent

03:17:53.782 --> 03:17:56.551
reliability, superb performance,
especially on the city's unique

03:17:57.319 --> 03:17:59.319
topography and unbeatable

03:17:59.689 --> 03:18:01.990
environmental credentials. But
the 2018 zero emissions policy

03:18:03.926 --> 03:18:05.926
made what at least to me was

03:18:05.962 --> 03:18:08.897
always a bewildering decision to
plan for a total phase out of

03:18:09.999 --> 03:18:12.634
the trolley bus network in favor
of battery electric busses.

03:18:12.702 --> 03:18:14.702
While I support these and I

03:18:15.538 --> 03:18:17.706
support hybrid busses on routes
that are not currently wired,

03:18:18.474 --> 03:18:20.376
they still can't match the
unparalleled performance of the

03:18:21.544 --> 03:18:24.513
tried and true trolley bus.
Therefore, I strongly encourage

03:18:26.182 --> 03:18:28.182
you to support this agenda item

03:18:29.652 --> 03:18:31.186
which amends the 2018 policy and
explicitly recognizes the

03:18:31.754 --> 03:18:33.754
trolleybus network's value and

03:18:35.392 --> 03:18:38.294
future contribution to a 100%
zero emissions fleet. Let's not

03:18:40.263 --> 03:18:42.263
repeat the mistake of the 1950s,

03:18:42.566 --> 03:18:44.767
when the city gave up most of
its remaining streetcar lines.

03:18:47.637 --> 03:18:50.472
We learned then that once
transportation infrastructure is

03:18:51.508 --> 03:18:53.508
gone, we never get it back. And

03:18:54.578 --> 03:18:57.448
with no shade to the muni metro
system, about which we've just

03:18:57.448 --> 03:19:00.316
heard lots about the upgrade
plans, the trolley bus system is

03:19:01.418 --> 03:19:03.418
the crown jewel of the muni

03:19:04.421 --> 03:19:06.421
system. Let's treat it as such.

03:19:06.423 --> 03:19:08.423
Thank you. Thank you for your

03:19:12.396 --> 03:19:14.396
comments. Next speaker, please.

03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:18.268
Um, why does why did carb not
see the lights and why do they

03:19:19.903 --> 03:19:21.903
pick on transit agencies to

03:19:22.206 --> 03:19:24.206
improve? It's the same thing

03:19:24.675 --> 03:19:26.675
that sfmta sadly suffers from.

03:19:27.879 --> 03:19:29.879
It's very hard to say no to cars

03:19:31.582 --> 03:19:33.650
, but we've got to the I'm
curious what the trolley bus

03:19:35.919 --> 03:19:37.919
pricing is in contrast to the

03:19:38.189 --> 03:19:40.189
hybrid and the battery electric

03:19:40.458 --> 03:19:42.458
bus pricing mainten bus is going

03:19:42.559 --> 03:19:44.559
to be lower for battery electric

03:19:46.498 --> 03:19:48.598
busses and trolleys will
absolutely be lower, too. I know

03:19:49.367 --> 03:19:51.535
you have to translate that into
maintaining the catenary, but

03:19:53.671 --> 03:19:55.671
it's still going to be cheaper.

03:19:56.541 --> 03:19:58.541
We need to say no, just out of

03:19:58.809 --> 03:20:01.344
principle in the city. No more
diesel. None. None should be

03:20:02.180 --> 03:20:04.180
purchased. It's just a silly way

03:20:04.349 --> 03:20:06.349
to spend our money and we do. I

03:20:06.517 --> 03:20:08.517
remember your words, chair

03:20:10.356 --> 03:20:12.356
aitken, about about how much is

03:20:12.424 --> 03:20:15.225
it going to cost to get us what
we want to get us? What we

03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:17.960
deserve? You've said this for

03:20:18.263 --> 03:20:20.263
active transportation. What does

03:20:21.133 --> 03:20:23.935
it take to get us this connected
network to get us a safe streets

03:20:24.503 --> 03:20:26.503
that our city is worthy of what

03:20:28.140 --> 03:20:30.140
people any person deserves to

03:20:30.909 --> 03:20:32.843
have? What is the same thing we
need for our transit network?

03:20:33.578 --> 03:20:35.646
That is what we need to be
working towards. What is that

03:20:36.348 --> 03:20:38.348
number? And how do we roll it

03:20:38.384 --> 03:20:40.384
out? And I'm not saying you just

03:20:40.786 --> 03:20:42.786
spend it all, but we have to

03:20:42.921 --> 03:20:45.560
start limiting cars. We have to
make it expensive. We have to

03:20:45.657 --> 03:20:48.326
make it difficult. We have to
take the lanes and we have to

03:20:48.427 --> 03:20:51.329
charge them and take that money
and put it towards transit and

03:20:53.933 --> 03:20:55.933
active transportation. And I

03:20:56.350 --> 03:20:58.303
it's very difficult to hear that
we don't have the money or we've

03:20:59.605 --> 03:21:01.639
got to buy this because it's
cheaper and whatever. When I

03:21:02.274 --> 03:21:04.509
know it's costly in many other
ways over the long haul. Please

03:21:05.477 --> 03:21:07.477
charge the cars and make the

03:21:07.780 --> 03:21:09.714
transit and active
transportation that we need.

03:21:10.917 --> 03:21:12.917
Thanks guys. Thank you. Next

03:21:15.822 --> 03:21:17.822
speaker, please. Good afternoon,

03:21:17.890 --> 03:21:20.125
directors. My name is cyrus hall
. I urge you to move forward

03:21:20.293 --> 03:21:22.293
with the suggested modifications

03:21:22.561 --> 03:21:25.330
to muni policy. I want to
highlight a couple of really

03:21:25.331 --> 03:21:28.299
important changes here that
julie talked about. One is
resynchronizing vehicle purchase

03:21:28.568 --> 03:21:30.568
schedules with capital plans

03:21:30.570 --> 03:21:32.570
around facility upgrades to

03:21:32.739 --> 03:21:35.640
synchronizing the vehicle plans
of carbs policies, including

03:21:37.277 --> 03:21:39.277
carbs recognition of trolley

03:21:39.312 --> 03:21:41.312
busses as zero emission vehicles

03:21:41.781 --> 03:21:43.915
, and three vitally re-embracing
the trolley busses as part of

03:21:45.786 --> 03:21:48.654
the agency's zev plans. I really
agree with what was said that

03:21:48.722 --> 03:21:51.230
the environmental north star and
best option for reducing

03:21:53.560 --> 03:21:55.694
emissions is making sure that we
can increase service and keep

03:21:56.663 --> 03:21:58.663
service stable and we need to do

03:21:58.798 --> 03:22:00.699
whatever it takes to make that
happen. But I am concerned that

03:22:01.901 --> 03:22:04.604
the suggested plan to purchase a
significant number of new diesel

03:22:06.730 --> 03:22:08.642
hybrids when we know that
hundreds of trolley busses, not

03:22:08.642 --> 03:22:11.377
hundreds, around 100 trolley
busses will be sitting idle

03:22:12.646 --> 03:22:14.646
because of a lack of space for

03:22:14.748 --> 03:22:16.748
regular maintenance during the

03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:18.950
patrol yard redevelopment that

03:22:18.952 --> 03:22:21.200
there had been a plan to provide
temporary space to continue the

03:22:21.222 --> 03:22:23.222
use of these already purchased

03:22:23.624 --> 03:22:26.920
trolley busses. That space was
reallocated and my

03:22:26.930 --> 03:22:28.328
understanding, because it was
needed elsewhere. And my

03:22:29.296 --> 03:22:31.296
question today is rather than

03:22:32.166 --> 03:22:34.967
buying as large of a new fleet
of diesel hybrids as being

03:22:36.203 --> 03:22:38.571
suggested, can we find space and
get those busses back on the

03:22:39.674 --> 03:22:41.674
road? We already own them. Is

03:22:42.210 --> 03:22:44.210
there a cost effective plan to

03:22:44.712 --> 03:22:46.712
make that happen? I would also

03:22:47.214 --> 03:22:49.249
ask you to reconsider yard
redevelopment plans in light of

03:22:51.180 --> 03:22:53.190
today's policy changes. The
presidio yard, for example,

03:22:53.920 --> 03:22:56.122
could accommodate modern amc
trolley busses as yard

03:22:58.259 --> 03:23:01.280
redevelopment should be done in
alignment with comprehensive
system electrification analysis

03:23:02.163 --> 03:23:04.163
that reflects the challenges of

03:23:04.799 --> 03:23:07.134
b e b's, battery electrics and
the fit to function nature of

03:23:07.502 --> 03:23:09.769
trolley busses. I also want to
say I deeply appreciate I'm

03:23:10.710 --> 03:23:12.238
looking at this from the
outside. It's a very complex

03:23:13.942 --> 03:23:16.760
topic and I appreciate staff's
dedication and hard work to make

03:23:16.811 --> 03:23:18.845
these decisions in the most
efficient way possible. Thank

03:23:21.583 --> 03:23:23.583
you very much. I'm not seeing

03:23:24.185 --> 03:23:26.386
any other speakers in the room.
Please go to remote at this

03:23:26.521 --> 03:23:29.289
time. We'll move to remote
public comment not to exceed a

03:23:29.490 --> 03:23:32.126
total time of ten minutes.
Members of the public wishing to

03:23:32.528 --> 03:23:35.196
comment should dial star three
to enter the queue each speaker

03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:37.330
will have two minutes. Moderator

03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:43.904
first speaker. Thanks again,
chair amanda. Alida dupree. For

03:23:44.500 --> 03:23:46.740
the record, she and her I'm
simply an ordinary user of muni

03:23:48.711 --> 03:23:50.711
and other systems. I do support

03:23:52.715 --> 03:23:54.715
trolley busses. We should not

03:23:55.451 --> 03:23:57.451
remove one foot of wire. I think

03:23:57.586 --> 03:23:59.586
that we should consider the

03:24:01.256 --> 03:24:03.256
expansion of trolley bus network

03:24:03.792 --> 03:24:05.792
and that should be a part of our

03:24:06.829 --> 03:24:08.829
toolbox. But I don't think that

03:24:08.864 --> 03:24:10.864
we should buy any more diesel

03:24:13.102 --> 03:24:15.102
vehicles or is even renewable.

03:24:16.805 --> 03:24:18.805
Diesel does produce particulates

03:24:19.308 --> 03:24:21.308
which are impactful,

03:24:21.443 --> 03:24:24.146
unfortunately, and not so good
ways. Maybe not as much as

03:24:24.847 --> 03:24:27.816
straight petroleum diesel, but
it does produce particulates and

03:24:29.180 --> 03:24:31.820
limited production. Run of
renewable diesel. That diesel

03:24:33.856 --> 03:24:35.757
would be probably better used in
the trucking industry or the

03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:39.760
railroad industry because
they're going to take a lot more

03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:42.630
time to transition than what we

03:24:42.765 --> 03:24:44.765
can do here. It doesn't seem

03:24:46.849 --> 03:24:49.238
like it's hard to get charging
equipment. There's charging
stations for cars and light

03:24:49.672 --> 03:24:51.672
vehicles being built all over

03:24:52.141 --> 03:24:54.141
the country, some of which have

03:24:54.810 --> 03:24:56.810
capabilities as high as 350kw

03:24:56.946 --> 03:24:58.946
more than what we would use for

03:25:00.684 --> 03:25:03.519
a bus change is hard, but I
practiced my values by living in

03:25:06.356 --> 03:25:08.356
a home that operates on 100%

03:25:08.491 --> 03:25:10.491
solar energy, electricity and my

03:25:13.496 --> 03:25:16.298
home. Is 100% electric. We have
no gas service in here and I

03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:21.360
don't want it 30s and I take 53

03:25:21.939 --> 03:25:23.973
years of using the new york city
subway, which runs on

03:25:25.308 --> 03:25:27.308
electricity. So san francisco

03:25:27.511 --> 03:25:29.511
has a very green fleet, but to

03:25:29.713 --> 03:25:31.713
me, buying diesel busses is like

03:25:32.716 --> 03:25:34.851
using candles to power for a
power failure in your home.

03:25:36.153 --> 03:25:38.254
Instead of a flashlight. I
choose to look forward. Thank

03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:45.660
you. Thank you. Next speaker.

03:25:47.764 --> 03:25:49.764
hello I cape grasteinn. I'm also

03:25:49.833 --> 03:25:51.833
a regular transit rider and I'm

03:25:52.370 --> 03:25:54.370
exiting the comics by alex and

03:25:55.506 --> 03:25:57.607
cyrus and other people that
yeah, we should really look to

03:25:59.744 --> 03:26:01.744
avoid diesel purchases because

03:26:01.979 --> 03:26:03.979
we have operating costs that are

03:26:04.715 --> 03:26:07.150
both will probably be higher and
also are unknowable and could be

03:26:07.785 --> 03:26:09.785
much higher. Diesel prices go up

03:26:11.623 --> 03:26:14.558
exponential. Suddenly we have
dozens, as I said, unused

03:26:15.260 --> 03:26:17.260
trolley busses and we could

03:26:17.462 --> 03:26:19.462
really try to use them and we

03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:23.650
can try to deploy these trolley

03:26:24.802 --> 03:26:26.437
busses like, for example, the
seven and nine lines or

03:26:27.305 --> 03:26:30.274
candidates that we could use for
bus rapid transit and then also

03:26:33.678 --> 03:26:36.446
install in motion charging. So I
think I think there's a way to

03:26:37.648 --> 03:26:39.648
really focus on avoiding diesel

03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:42.840
and looking at continuing

03:26:43.922 --> 03:26:46.490
trolley busses and looking at
maybe different way to redevelop

03:26:49.961 --> 03:26:51.961
the portrayal yard in the

03:26:51.963 --> 03:26:53.963
context of emphasizing trolley

03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:56.320
busses. So yeah, I would urge

03:26:57.802 --> 03:26:59.802
sfmta to do that. Thank you.

03:27:09.181 --> 03:27:11.182
Thank you. Next speaker, our.
Speaker, you've been unmuted.

03:27:11.817 --> 03:27:14.518
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
My name is pete wilson. I am a

03:27:14.619 --> 03:27:16.619
trolley bus operator. I'm asking

03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:19.891
that you do not close potrero
the crown jewel of our busses

03:27:19.892 --> 03:27:22.761
are the electric 60 foot trolley
busses, like on the five, the

03:27:23.262 --> 03:27:25.262
14, the 30, the 49. Please don't

03:27:26.665 --> 03:27:28.866
close potrero trolleys charged
during the day while they drive,

03:27:29.601 --> 03:27:32.369
not back at the yard with huge
storage batteries at the yards.

03:27:32.738 --> 03:27:35.606
Please don't close potrero.
There's a spot behind me where

03:27:36.876 --> 03:27:39.578
the plan was all along to put
our busses back there. Now we're

03:27:39.745 --> 03:27:42.547
going to put our busses back
there in mothball them. Please

03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:45.517
don't close potrero. Many cities
like la pulled their tracks out

03:27:46.318 --> 03:27:48.453
in the 50s. We now have another
opportunity to notice a lot of

03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:51.222
people pulled out their wires
like cambridge just did not. So

03:27:52.191 --> 03:27:54.191
excuse me, their wires are still

03:27:54.894 --> 03:27:57.496
up, but they just got rid of
their busses. So don't close
potrero renewal. Renewable

03:27:59.265 --> 03:28:01.265
diesel is decreases carbon by

03:28:02.268 --> 03:28:05.360
65. That's still 35% carbon
don't close potrero potrero is

03:28:05.938 --> 03:28:08.673
central. Yes with julie alluding
to getting rid of presidio.

03:28:10.176 --> 03:28:12.311
Please don't. We need to expand?
We don't need to contract.

03:28:13.346 --> 03:28:15.346
Please don't close potrero.

03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:18.750
Thank you very much. Thank you.

03:28:24.190 --> 03:28:26.190
Next speaker. Good afternoon.

03:28:26.426 --> 03:28:29.395
This is peter strauss. I'm on
the board of san francisco

03:28:32.132 --> 03:28:34.834
transit riders and I'm speaking,
which I think I can be pretty

03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:38.537
brief, but I'm urging you to
support the staff's

03:28:41.341 --> 03:28:43.341
recommendation today. This is a

03:28:43.643 --> 03:28:45.643
very appropriate and necessary

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:47.980
course correction to the 2018

03:28:48.115 --> 03:28:50.115
policy, which in many ways was

03:28:50.250 --> 03:28:52.250
short sighted and inappropriate.

03:28:52.653 --> 03:28:55.121
And this is the right step for
the agency and the right step

03:28:56.523 --> 03:28:58.658
for carb to allow the continued
use of trolley coaches at this

03:29:00.427 --> 03:29:02.427
time. Um, that said, within this

03:29:02.429 --> 03:29:04.965
policy, I'm very encouraged by
the last thing julie referred

03:29:05.266 --> 03:29:08.134
to, which was the improved
batteries for the trolley coach

03:29:09.103 --> 03:29:11.103
fleet that will allow the in

03:29:12.273 --> 03:29:14.273
motion and route charger thing

03:29:14.608 --> 03:29:16.608
and urge the staff to consider

03:29:17.644 --> 03:29:20.379
the use of trolley coaches with
such batteries at the earliest

03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:24.250
possible time on such lines as
the seven and the nine which

03:29:25.553 --> 03:29:28.522
operate mostly under wire today
and can be expanded to make

03:29:29.657 --> 03:29:31.657
better use of our trolley coach

03:29:31.925 --> 03:29:33.994
fleet and electrify them fully
that much sooner. Thank you for

03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:37.764
your time and thank you for your
consideration of this. Thank

03:29:42.804 --> 03:29:44.804
you. Next speaker. This is

03:29:46.341 --> 03:29:48.341
herbert weiner. I strongly

03:29:49.900 --> 03:29:51.900
support the proposals, but I do

03:29:52.580 --> 03:29:54.580
think you have to restore the 47

03:29:56.251 --> 03:29:58.986
potrero and three jackson lines.
They are very important trolley

03:30:01.256 --> 03:30:03.256
lines and I think the city

03:30:03.891 --> 03:30:05.891
really misses them. So to

03:30:06.261 --> 03:30:08.261
enhance trolley service, please

03:30:08.329 --> 03:30:10.329
restore these lines. They're

03:30:10.365 --> 03:30:12.365
very important to the public.

03:30:17.472 --> 03:30:19.472
Thank you. Thank you. We have no

03:30:19.908 --> 03:30:22.877
additional callers. Okay. We'll
close public comment. Director

03:30:24.579 --> 03:30:26.780
kirschbaum. I just wonder if you
might be willing to address some

03:30:27.415 --> 03:30:29.516
of the themes that we heard in
public comment around the sort

03:30:30.152 --> 03:30:32.152
of desire for a bright line of

03:30:32.922 --> 03:30:34.923
no new diesel purchases. And the
question about whether trolley

03:30:35.824 --> 03:30:37.824
busses could play more of a role

03:30:38.126 --> 03:30:40.126
in our needs going forward. Yeah

03:30:42.130 --> 03:30:44.130
absolutely. When we were first

03:30:46.680 --> 03:30:48.680
planning to move potrero during

03:30:49.500 --> 03:30:51.500
construction, we had a peak bus

03:30:53.142 --> 03:30:55.310
demand of about 630 vehicles at
and we didn't have a bus to

03:30:55.611 --> 03:30:57.611
spare because every other

03:30:59.148 --> 03:31:01.148
vehicle we were using to do the

03:31:01.383 --> 03:31:03.383
maintenance that I'm always

03:31:04.820 --> 03:31:06.820
bragging about our current peak

03:31:08.524 --> 03:31:10.726
demand is just over 500. So we
are in a much different

03:31:13.863 --> 03:31:15.863
situation than we were in 2018.

03:31:16.265 --> 03:31:18.900
In 2018, our vehicle, our
facility program was being

03:31:19.802 --> 03:31:21.802
anchored by the fact that we

03:31:23.774 --> 03:31:26.742
were planning to spend had about
$150 million to move potrero

03:31:29.479 --> 03:31:31.680
this would not be a facility
that we owned. It was a port

03:31:33.683 --> 03:31:35.683
owned facility and it would be

03:31:36.319 --> 03:31:38.319
an investment with a very short

03:31:39.622 --> 03:31:42.491
term purpose. So I'm very
grateful that we've been able to

03:31:43.994 --> 03:31:46.462
shift the plan and take some of
those precious dollars and

03:31:47.664 --> 03:31:49.664
invest them in in kirkland,

03:31:49.699 --> 03:31:51.699
which we see as the first all

03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:55.670
electric facility. I also want

03:31:55.738 --> 03:31:57.738
to point out that while our

03:32:00.711 --> 03:32:03.379
current demand is about 510, I
very much believe that we are

03:32:05.315 --> 03:32:07.315
going to need to grow our

03:32:08.685 --> 03:32:10.685
service. S as the city recovers,

03:32:10.887 --> 03:32:12.887
as we come up with stronger our

03:32:12.956 --> 03:32:14.956
financial approach is

03:32:16.527 --> 03:32:18.527
collectively to get transit back

03:32:20.731 --> 03:32:22.731
to a thriving state. So I don't

03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:25.340
think that we can look to the

03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:28.870
vehicles that were storing as

03:32:29.440 --> 03:32:31.440
our answer because they will be

03:32:31.908 --> 03:32:33.908
back on the road by 2028. The

03:32:34.846 --> 03:32:36.846
vehicles that I'm talking about

03:32:37.849 --> 03:32:39.849
purchasing in 2025 and 2026 will

03:32:41.152 --> 03:32:43.152
have a 12 year lifespan as well.

03:32:43.554 --> 03:32:45.554
Well past that kind of two year

03:32:47.391 --> 03:32:49.391
bridge. So I do enthusiastically

03:32:49.995 --> 03:32:51.995
support trolley. It's exciting

03:32:52.665 --> 03:32:54.665
to see so many san franciscans

03:32:55.433 --> 03:32:57.433
really express their love for

03:32:57.669 --> 03:32:59.669
this unique and important mode.

03:33:00.405 --> 03:33:02.606
But I do believe that some of
the advocacy has been

03:33:05.443 --> 03:33:08.111
significantly oversimplified and
does not look at all of the

03:33:09.814 --> 03:33:11.814
complexities of a large scale

03:33:15.453 --> 03:33:18.355
trolley expansion. Well okay. I
think we had a motion. Is that

03:33:21.292 --> 03:33:23.292
right? Or director lindsay, were

03:33:24.595 --> 03:33:26.595
you going to make a motion? Oh,

03:33:28.667 --> 03:33:30.801
MADAM Chair, I'd be happy to.
Yes. Thank you. Is there a

03:33:31.970 --> 03:33:33.970
second? I will approval second.

03:33:34.806 --> 03:33:37.242
Great. Please call the roll on
the motion to approve director

03:33:37.242 --> 03:33:39.310
heminger heminger. Director
henderson I henderson. I

03:33:40.145 --> 03:33:42.145
director hinsey kinsey I

03:33:44.490 --> 03:33:46.490
director. So I. So I chair eken.

03:33:46.785 --> 03:33:49.454
I eken. I thank you that item is
approved and concludes the
business before you today. Okay.

03:33:50.289 --> 03:33:52.390
Thank you. Colleagues, staff,
members of the public. We are

03:33:52.824 --> 03:33:54.824
adjourned. Next meeting started

03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:57.360
in NOVEMBER 21st and DECEMBER

03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:16.790
5th.
