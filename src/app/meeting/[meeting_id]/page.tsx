// The San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting on November 28, 2023, began with the acknowledgment of the Ramaytush Ohlone people as the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. The Board proceeded with the Pledge of Allegiance, communications, and approval of previous meeting minutes. Consent agenda items 1-17 were approved, and no items were removed for separate consideration.

// The board then discussed a third draft of a charter amendment related to the police department staffing levels. Supervisor Safai, the sponsor, emphasized the budgetary challenges the city faces and the need for a thoughtful conversation about all aspects of public safety. He also mentioned a fiscal responsibility amendment that requires a funding source for any new measures. The amendment aims to change the conversation around minimum police staffing levels. Various supervisors expressed their opinions on the matter. Some voiced concerns about the implications of the amendment and the cityâ€™s budget deficit.

// Other notable items included approval of grant funding for the Buchanan Mall project and various lease approvals for city properties. The board also discussed an ordinance to extend the cannabis event pilot program and an amendment to the business and tax regulations code related to transfer tax rates for affordable housing.

// During general public comments, individuals spoke on various topics, including technology concerns, housing issues, safety, and recognition of community leaders.

// The Board also recognized Martha Ryan, the founder and executive director emeritus of the Homeless Prenatal Program, for her contributions to the city and her work with vulnerable populations.

// Supervisor Safai introduced legislation to restore and expand the Homeward Bound program.

// At the end of the meeting, the Board adjourned in memory of Marsalina Marsal V. Espinosa, and several items were submitted for future consideration without discussion.

// The session concluded with the imperative agenda item recognizing November 28, 2023, as In-Home Supportive Services Provider Day in San Francisco. The resolution was adopted unanimously.
